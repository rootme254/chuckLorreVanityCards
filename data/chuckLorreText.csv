"As some of you might know, I have long avoided having any socialmedia presence. I am completely ignorant of all things Facebook,Instagram, Snapchat, and whatever other cyberforum the teenagecognoscenti have recently anointed. I know the pound sign is acrucial element to communicating via Twitter, but have neverpersonally tried it. More importantly, I don't feel like I'mmissing anything. My life doesn't feel lesser for it. When Ibegan these vanity cards almost twenty years ago, I decided thatthey were a perfectly adequate way of communicating my personalthoughts on a large scale. Sure, they're a one-way communication,but I actually prefer that. My thinking was, and still is, thatthis world of ours already sends too many messages. Or perhapsconsciousness, by its very nature, acquiesces to being barraged.Either way, my self-preservation seemed to demand digitalinaccessibility.

"President Roosevelt famously said, ""...the only thing we have tofear, is fear itself."" Now, let's take a moment and ask ourselves,which presidential candidates and cable news networks are activelypromoting fear? Which one of these people and corporate entitiesare determined to scare your pants off, in the hope that you'lleither vote for them or stay tuned? Or let's approach this from adifferent angle. After millions of years of evolution, or six daysof divine creation, it doesn't really matter which, our brains arewired to seek out danger and respond accordingly. Fight or flightor, if it's not trying to eat you, negotiate. It makes sense then,that presenting a threat to our survival is a time-tested way toget the brain's attention. And let's be clear about one thing;attention is the most valuable commodity in the world. Once youhave someone's attention you can sell them something, or, if you'rethe kind of person who is frightened of self-determined people,control them - while reassuring them that your only concern istheir right to be self-determined. (This is not to say that therearen't people who have ample reason to be afraid. I'm just gonnago out on a limb and say you're probably not one of them.) So thereal question to ask yourself is not who or what should you beafraid of, it's how are you doing right now. Go ahead. Askyourself. Are you in jeopardy right now? Of course not. You'resquinting at this vanity card and perhaps wondering if there's aclever joke at the end of it. (Spoiler alert: there is not.) Thismeans that whatever you're afraid of, or being encouraged to beafraid of, is in your mind. It is not in your living room, or justoutside your door. You're thinking it. Which is good news.That's the one thing you have control over. At any moment, you cantake a break from thinking scary thoughts, or, if you're like meand have a mind run amuck, you can choose to ignore them. Evenbetter news, once you're free of self-imposed fear, you're muchless likely to seek out an old, white guy to protect you. (Well,maybe there is.)",2016-01-14,"Mom"

"This past year I was inspired by the transgender movement which, to me, appears tobe an effort to synchronize one's outward sexual identity with one's internal sexualexperience. I couldn't help but notice that, in many cases, the people who do thisappear to be extremely happy. Which got me thinking. I want to be extremelyhappy. Maybe it's time for me to make a change. But then I realized my discomfortis not with having a male human body. It's with having any human body. With thatin mind, my next step was obvious. I started looking for a reputable surgeon whowould help me become the first member of the trans-species movement. My hopewas to become a porpoise, or a hawk. (I'm a big fan of hawks, with all the gliding andswooping.) After a long, exhausting search, I found a highly-regarded doctor inPyongyang who was more than willing to do the operation if I could sneak him intoSeoul. Which I did. But then, minutes before the procedure was to begin, I was toldthat once again my Writers Guild insurance wouldn't pay. Filled with frustration, Idecided to lose my troublesome body altogether and become trans-human.

"I've long believed that my vanity cards should not just be used for light entertainment. Every once in awhile a card should be written that aspires to make life better for everyone who takes the time to read it. This is one of those cards. After years of struggle, I've finally figured out how to eat cookies in bed without getting crumbs all over the place. The trick is to break the cookies into small bite-sized pieces while still in the box or bag, then, and only then, pop the pieces into your mouth. Get it? There are no crumbs because the cookies are never bitten, they're only chewed. Of course, there is some downside risk. Whenever you bring an entire box or bag of cookies into bed, there is a strong likelihood that you will eat every cookie in the box or bag. This means that your bed, while crumb free, will be filled with regret. Not to worry. In a future vanity card I will explain how to handle regret. Like cookies, it involves breaking it into bite-sized pieces.",2015-12-10,"Mom"

"For the comedian, comic actor or comedy writer, nothing inflates the ego like the sound of people laughing. Nothing crushes it like their silence. This gives the audience enormous power. It's why performers and writers use the word ""kill"" to describe material that causes an explosion of laughter. ""That joke killed"" is a way of saying that, for a brief moment, they were able to dominate and control people who otherwise might hurt their feelings. For a brief moment they are victors, not victims. It also explains why many critics, network executives and ""cool"" people remain stoic in the face of good comedy. Laughing out loud makes one appear vulnerable. Killable. These people are also defending fragile egos. Which raises the question, what happens to comedy when the human ego is removed? When laughter, or its absence, neither builds nor destroys this phantasm self?Sadly, I wouldn't know.""The only cure for vanity is laughter, and the only fault that is laughable is vanity.""Henri Bergson",2015-11-19,"Mom"
"Sometimes I feel like I'm standing on a dock watching Western culture drift away from me like a massive boat. As I imagine it, the people on the deck are not waving goodbye. They're looking away, toward the horizon. The future. And the boat is accelerating. I don't bring this up to generate sympathy. No one threw me overboard. Disembarking was a conscious choice. And so is returning. With a little effort I can take a skiff out to sea and scramble up that gangplank anytime I want. I just have to stop being afraid of Facebook. And Instagram. And Twitter. And LinkedIn. And Tumblr. And Pinterest. And Snapchat. And, well... I guess the Internet. Also, I might need to jettison my love for belabored maritime metaphors.",2015-11-12,"Mom"
"I grew up devouring science fiction books. I was like a little Pac-Man, gobbling up everything I could get my hands on: short stories, novels, and, of course, comic books. Looking back, I realize that sci-fi and, to some degree, fantasy novels, were my first attempt at escaping reality (later attempts would prove to be a bit more problematic). Regardless, I now see that immersing myself in this kind of literature informs my current view of the world. The path of history is, for me, forever seen through the eyes and imagination of Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, Ray Bradbury, Roger Zelazny, Frank Herbert, Larry Niven, Philip K. Dick, H.G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, and many, many more. Which is why I consider all efforts to control human behavior through force as ultimately doomed to fail. Sure, they might work for a while. That's where the cool story is - the resistance and overcoming of authoritarian rule. But at the end of the day, the macro, sci-fi view is always toward greater freedom, regardless of what form it takes. The real evil, the much more insidious method of control, is actually what we do to ourselves. The abuse of drugs and alcohol, plus relentless consumerism and over-exposure to mind-numbing entertainment, are the real chains on the human spirit. Of course this means that I, having produced close to a thousand half-hours of television, am part of the problem. Sorry. I never meant to be a Minor Overlord for the Terrestrial Shadow Masters.",2015-11-05,"Mom"
"I've been around sitcoms for almost thirty years. During that time I've heard a lot of laughter from studio audiences, writers, actors, directors, studio executives, cameramen and myself. But not all laughter is created equal. There are the lonely guffaws of nervous writers and directors anxious to fill the silence that trails behind some jokes like toilet paper on a shoe. And then there's the grimacing, head-bob throat chuckle of network executives. For years I took this strangled, tepid response personally. Now I know it for what it is - the sound of fear. Sometimes studio audiences will try and help a show with what we in the business call ""a mercy laugh."" There's no mistaking this one. It's the sound of two hundred people who just want to go home. And finally, there's the true, out loud, involuntary explosion of laughter. It's a beautiful, contagious sound. For comedy writers, it makes you feel like your life has value. That all your neurotic suffering is worthwhile. Actors have told me it makes them feel like they're surfing a wave of pure happiness... and that they can keep their kids in private school. Network executives tell me they're not sure how they feel until the results from the focus group comes in. Regardless, in a troubled world, real laughter, that spontaneous outburst of humanness, has to be taken as seriously as a wet fart in white pants.",2015-04-30,"Mom"

"To be read aloud at my funeral.Well... this is depressing. Which, I guess, beats the alternative. Certainly don't want my send off to be a ding-dong-the-witch-is- dead flash mob. Perhaps there's a middle ground. A little light sobbing, some clothes rending. Nothing over the top. To all the actors here, let's try and keep this day about me. Okay, now that we've settled on the appropriate level of somber, I'd like to go over a few things before LIFE GOES ON WITHOUT ME, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! First, I want it known that I am deeply grateful for how things turned out. In retrospect - and yes, everything is in retrospect now - even the awful stuff seems to have had a purpose. When I was a young man a pretty girl smiled at me, so I did exactly what any young man would do, I joined her new-age religion. Seven years later I awoke, as if from a dream, and carried on like nothing happened. Which made sense because for seven years nothing happened. Being too poor to go to a doctor when I had ulcerative colitis made me a big supporter of free health care, as well as appreciative of the life-affirming qualities in a good bowel movement. Two failed marriages and many failed relationships taught me the fine art of apologizing. A decade or so of professional failures proved that hardship builds character, just not a very good one. And then there's all the great things that happened. My children - despite years of fatherly neglect - turned out to be awesome. Shaking off a severe drop in revenue, the Jack Daniels company managed to limp along without me. I stumbled into an incredible career when I realized I had a better chance at becoming the next Sherwood Schwartz than the next Bruce Springsteen. So again, looking back, other than dying, I have no real complaints. Looking forward, well, if the lights in the chapel flicker... NOW!... it means I'm a non-corporeal spiritual entity with a delightful streak of mischievousness (more Spooky than Casper). If not, the likely scenario is I exist only in your memories, and, after the ceremony, as landfill in a Jewish cemetery. So, to sum up a lifetime: ""Here lies me. I did the best I could with what I had. I never stopped trying to be better. My flaws were plentiful. No need to list them here. We all know what they were -- don't we ladies? But I did love. And as I got older I think I learned how to love more. I hope that's what you remember about me.""""And that I was perfectly willing to end a heartfelt moment with a cheap dick joke.""",2015-04-16,"Mom"
"Hardly  a  day  goes  by  when  I  don't  think  about  quitting  this business.  Hanging it up.  Taking my proverbial bat and ball and going  home.   In  my  imagination,  the  day  after  I  quit  is  a wonderful,  relaxing,  joyful  experience.   I  reconnect  with  old friends, walk on the beach, read, listen to music, play guitar, play  golf,  eat  leisurely  meals  off  of  real  plates,  exercise, meditate, maybe go see a matinee, or take a stab at writing a few pages  of  a  self-indulgent,  joke-free  play  filled  with  people screaming  at  each  other,  and  then,  after  taking  the  dog  for  a walk, climb into bed and fall into a peaceful, stress-free sleep.  The day after that, bored out of my mind, I start drinking around the clock and quickly descend into a dark, frothing madness that leads to either being institutionalized or liver failure and an agonizing,  premature  death.   The  really  scary  part?   There's hardly  a  day  goes  by  when  I  don't  think  about  quitting  this business. ",2011-10-03,"Mom"
"I tried meditating on the beach today. After a few minutes of gazing out at the ocean these words floated up into my consciousness, ""An impersonal, life-creating vastness that is ever-changing."" The metaphor touched me deeply. It seemed as if time stopped, or at least was on hold. A feeling of peace came upon me, or more accurately, from within me. Then a new thought wafted, ""I am alive in an impersonal universe and I can't help but take it personally."" Then another thought, ""Life is sustained by eating other life. What's up with that?"" Then one more, ""Ever-changing is just a pompous way of saying $#!% happens."" Realizing I'd strayed from my meditation, I took a deep cleansing breath and once again looked out at the ocean. That simple joy and serenity I'd felt earlier returned immediately, followed by a new thought, or rather, sensation, ""I urgently have to urinate."" I looked around and saw no facilities. Not even a tree to hide behind. Desperate for relief, I looked back to the ocean and heard these words calmly whispered in my mind, ""Impersonal also means I will never judge you.""The water was cold, but I managed.",2015-04-02,"Mom"
"Random Advice to Young Comedy WritersDon't eat a heavy lunch. It's bad luck to sit in a director's chair with your name on it. Good ideas feel good. They're almost gentle. Be suspicious of ideas you're really, really, really excited about - it might be a bipolar thing. Never stand up when pitching an idea, you're probably excited. There's no getting around it, some pants are luckier than others. Comedy written at three AM isn't as funny as you think it is. Comedy written at three PM when you're drunk isn't as funny as you think it is. Comedy written at three PM, stone cold sober, rested and well-fed might be funny. Might not. You want certainty in your profession, try accounting. If a show fails it doesn't mean you're a bad person. It just feels that way. Sleep with a retainer in your mouth to avoid grinding your teeth to dust. When the audience doesn't laugh, your soul is not being dragged out your ass. It just feels that way. With that in mind, don't be fooled by laughter that is simply an act of mercy. Mom may love you, but she is not a good barometer of your talent. With that in mind, if your mother truly loves you, you're probably not a comedy writer. Never watch someone read your script. Use this time to go to the bathroom and pass blood. Try and put the funny word at the end of the sentence. But sometimes don't. Again, Uncertainty is thy God. People who write poisonous things about your work are using up precious moments of their life dwelling on yours. These are moments they will never get back. Let that be a comfort to you.

"Many, many, many, many years ago, I had a job as a greens keeper at a little par 3, nine hole golf course. Every morning I'd get up at dawn and drive the tractor-mower up and down the fairways. Then I'd roll the special lawnmower over the greens, trying my best to make them both beautiful and challenging. In my mind, I imagined I was grooming Augusta National. Thinking back I can't help but remember that time as being perfect. My heart was at peace, my work was fulfilling, and each day was a gentle echo of the one before. But I quit that job and moved to Los Angeles because I wanted more. Can you imagine that? I wanted more than a par 27 Walden Pond. Don't get me wrong, I am deeply grateful for the way things turned out. It's just, try as I might, I can't make a sitcom smell like fresh cut grass in the morning.",2015-03-05,"Mom"
"I recently found myself reminiscing about an incident that occurred almost thirty years ago. I had just landed my first job as a prime-time sitcom writer and was sitting in a room 'punching up' a script with a few other young writers and a couple of old pros, when one of the gray-haired, comedy mavens grumbled that the mediocre joke we were trying to improve was ""good enough"" and that we should ""move on."" He rationalized this by saying, ""No one will know the difference"" and, ""It's just a sitcom."" I remember being offended. I quietly promised myself that if I ever got a chance to write and produce my own series I would never think that way. I would never become so jaded and cynical that I squandered the opportunity to entertain people by assuming they ""won't know the difference,"" and by sneeringly regarding what I do for a living as being ""just a sitcom."" And I never have. But I have wondered what exactly is this thing I do. And I think I've finally figured it out. A sitcom is an extended conversation between writers, actors, directors and the audience. In success, the conversation goes on for years. Pre-internet, the viewers responded simply by watching or not watching. Now their opinions are loud, immediate and fully articulated. And it's great. And it's scary. But it's a real conversation between real people with real feelings. So we all need to choose our words carefully.",2015-02-26,"Mom"
"I start most of my vanity cards without knowing how to end them. I purposely write myself into a corner and then try to wriggle out of it. Which, I now realize, is the story of my life. Over and over, I have consciously entrapped myself in difficult situations and relationships and then struggled to get free. Which leads me to wonder, is this cycle the very essence of existence? Are we destined to live out an endless, self- imposed drama entitled ""stuck, free, stuck, free""? Or, with a bit more flourish, ""woe is me, hallelujah, woe is me, hallelujah""? And if this is the case, is life and death just one more variation on the theme? And is it the last? Does the pendulum swinging between entrapment and freedom continue beyond the grave? (Perhaps on a quantum level?) Which poses a new question. If we exist in an eternal loop of suffering and escape, why bother escaping? Why not just embrace the prison we're in? The answer, of course, is that surrender is its own form of freedom. Which is why I've given up on writing my way out of this vanity card.

"The things I have spent my life depending on are undependable. Because they are things. And things are, by their very nature, subject to change. This applies to people as well. People change. People leave. Inevitably we all leave. The world, therefore, is essentially an unstable, uncertain environment. That's why I choose to believe in, and depend on, an unchanging, eternal, omnipresent non-thing. I prefer not to call it God, because the very word tends to thing things up. So I try not to call it. I try to experience it. Easy to do looking out at the ocean. Hard to do looking up at the ocean. Easy to do when you look at a baby. Hard to do if the baby is next to you on a long plane flight. Easy to do when you look at a pretty girl. Hard to do if you were once married to her. Clearly what blocks me from transcendence is judgment. If I were able to suspend having an opinion on drowning, other peoples' baby's vomit, and alimony, if I could simply see these things as they are - actions devoid of meaning until I give them meaning - I could experience some semblance of union with the infinite sublime. I'd instantaneously transition from neurotic sitcom writer to one seriously badass guru dude. People would travel great distances to ask me for guidance with their personal problems.

Additionally, when conception became a fundamental female choice, as opposed to a random event, thousands of years of patriarchal rule came to an end.  That is why male-dominated religions and social institutions are so filled with rage right now.

It's called ""Chastity Jones"" and tells the story of a beautiful woman who, after being burned in relationship after relationship, decides never to have sex again. And I mean never. Which of course makes her wildly attractive to men who pursue her doggedly. And I mean doggedly. Regardless, she stays true to her vow. As the series progresses, every aspect of her life improves while all her friends who are out there, ankles up, banging away, suffer endless heartache. Honestly, I think it's the kind of show that could start a trend. Heck, with a little luck a deadly new STD will arrive from Africa and we'll be ahead of the curve! Alternative title: ""The Last Orgasm."" But we have to move quick here. I'm also trying for El Chapo's old job as el presidente of the Sinaloa Cartel. I've pitched them some great ideas about tunnels, mules and product placement. How much would sales go up if we could convince a few actors and musicians to endorse drugs? Huh? Huh?

"Not that it really matters, but the joke I made at the ProducersGuild Awards regarding Ben Affleck's genitals being of sufficient size to fill the caped crusader's codpiece was just that, a joke. I've never met Mr. Affleck in or out of a men's room. Nor am I in the habit of peeking at another guy's junk while standing at a urinal. (I mostly stare at the tiles and worry that the invisible auto-flush light beam is secretly cooking my internal organs.) I just wanted to open my speech with a cheap laugh about the Golden Globes. To be completely honest, the original version of the joke had me peeing next to and peeking at Martin Scorsese -- who was, at best, a grower not a show-er. I cut it, wisely I thought, because it felt unfair to ""belittle"" a giant of cinema, even if I had issues with ""Hugo."" I then considered telling the same joke with Harvey Weinstein as the celebrity at the neighboring stall, but cut that as well because I worried that he might be able to have me hurt. It was only when I thought of Mr. Affleck that it finally hit me. If I'm going to make up stuff about another man's penis, why not go positive? Embellish his endowment if you will. It's still funny. And it also allowed me to work in the Comic-Con Batman angle. Win-win right? Wrong. While the joke did score at the PGA event, it got way too much traction afterward. Which is why I now feel the need to set the record straight. You want to know if Affleck is man enough to be Bruce Wayne? Ask his wife. Or, if you're feeling man enough, rent ""Daredevil.""

"I had a recurring dream as a child that left an indelible mark on me. Unlike my other dreams, this one had no recognizable images, no mommies or daddies, no friends, relatives, teachers, scary monsters or scrappy Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek.  This dream was simply a field of darkness and light fighting to dominate my mental screen. That was it.  For what seemed like long periods of time, I would bear silent witness to a cosmic struggle between malicious, inky blackness and radiant, life-affirming light.  I would, of course, be pulling for the light to win.  But it never did.  No matter how much I willed it, light could never maintain the field of view.  Darkness would always come crawling back, invading the space and ultimately taking over.  It was both exhausting and upsetting.  Thankfully, at some point during early adolescence, the dream stopped, never to return.  Looking back, I see it as no more than an immature mind's attempt to reconcile good and evil.  I understand now that the world is not nearly that simple.  Those two opposing forces do not actually exist. They are evaluations. Opinions.  And yet, my mind continually tries to manifest them as being real.  I catch myself doing it whenever I toggle back and forth between MSNBC and Fox News playing out their cable TV version of my childhood dream.  The only difference is that I'm an adult now.

While there is no guarantee that the transgressor will be relieved of shame and guilt, the forgiver will always feel better. In other words, forgiveness is, first and foremost, self-serving. Now I am all about self-serving, so for the last few years I have been practicing a sort of forgiveness mantra.

"President Roosevelt famously said, ""...the only thing we have tofear, is fear itself."" Now, let's take a moment and ask ourselves,which presidential candidates and cable news networks are activelypromoting fear? Which one of these people and corporate entitiesare determined to scare your pants off, in the hope that you'lleither vote for them or stay tuned? Or let's approach this from adifferent angle. After millions of years of evolution, or six daysof divine creation, it doesn't really matter which, our brains arewired to seek out danger and respond accordingly. Fight or flightor, if it's not trying to eat you, negotiate. It makes sense then,that presenting a threat to our survival is a time-tested way toget the brain's attention. And let's be clear about one thing;attention is the most valuable commodity in the world. Once youhave someone's attention you can sell them something, or, if you'rethe kind of person who is frightened of self-determined people,control them - while reassuring them that your only concern istheir right to be self-determined. (This is not to say that therearen't people who have ample reason to be afraid. I'm just gonnago out on a limb and say you're probably not one of them.) So thereal question to ask yourself is not who or what should you beafraid of, it's how are you doing right now. Go ahead. Askyourself. Are you in jeopardy right now? Of course not. You'resquinting at this vanity card and perhaps wondering if there's aclever joke at the end of it. (Spoiler alert: there is not.) Thismeans that whatever you're afraid of, or being encouraged to beafraid of, is in your mind. It is not in your living room, or justoutside your door. You're thinking it.

At any moment, you cantake a break from thinking scary thoughts, or, if you're like meand have a mind run amuck, you can choose to ignore them.

"I've long believed that my vanity cards should not just be used for light entertainment. Every once in awhile a card should be written that aspires to make life better for everyone who takes the time to read it. This is one of those cards. After years of struggle, I've finally figured out how to eat cookies in bed without getting crumbs all over the place. The trick is to break the cookies into small bite-sized pieces while still in the box or bag, then, and only then, pop the pieces into your mouth. Get it? There are no crumbs because the cookies are never bitten, they're only chewed. Of course, there is some downside risk. Whenever you bring an entire box or bag of cookies into bed, there is a strong likelihood that you will eat every cookie in the box or bag. This means that your bed, while crumb free, will be filled with regret. Not to worry. In a future vanity card I will explain how to handle regret.

"I grew up devouring science fiction books. I was like a little Pac-Man, gobbling up everything I could get my hands on: short stories, novels, and, of course, comic books. Looking back, I realize that sci-fi and, to some degree, fantasy novels, were my first attempt at escaping reality (later attempts would prove to be a bit more problematic). Regardless, I now see that immersing myself in this kind of literature informs my current view of the world. The path of history is, for me, forever seen through the eyes and imagination of Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, Ray Bradbury, Roger Zelazny, Frank Herbert, Larry Niven, Philip K. Dick, H.G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, and many, many more. Which is why I consider all efforts to control human behavior through force as ultimately doomed to fail. Sure, they might work for a while. That's where the cool story is - the resistance and overcoming of authoritarian rule. But at the end of the day, the macro, sci-fi view is always toward greater freedom, regardless of what form it takes. The real evil, the much more insidious method of control, is actually what we do to ourselves. The abuse of drugs and alcohol, plus relentless consumerism and over-exposure to mind-numbing entertainment, are the real chains on the human spirit.

The memories, emotions, thoughts and attitudes that combine to create the self are finally recognized as nothing more than ripples on the surface of a pond. And the truth of what we are, collectively and individually, is the pond itself. That which silently embraces the endless dance of form. Deep. Clear. Still.

Simply put, we all arrive here screaming, crying and covered in goo, without prior consultation. Or so it appears.

What if we could become aware of the primary decision to live, the fateful choice to participate in the world of time, energy and form? Wouldn't that improve our daily condition? No matter how difficult and confusing life was, we would always be clear on one thing, ""I asked to be here. This is my choice."" Of course, there's another option to consider.

"The human mind is very adept at labeling. Left to its own devices, it will label situations, things, places, and people. It's a pretty handy app. Except when it comes to people.

And then there's the grimacing, head-bob throat chuckle of network executives. For years I took this strangled, tepid response personally. Now I know it for what it is - the sound of fear. Sometimes studio audiences will try and help a show with what we in the business call ""a mercy laugh."" There's no mistaking this one. It's the sound of two hundred people who just want to go home. And finally, there's the true, out loud, involuntary explosion of laughter. It's a beautiful, contagious sound. For comedy writers, it makes you feel like your life has value. That all your neurotic suffering is worthwhile. Actors have told me it makes them feel like they're surfing a wave of pure happiness... and that they can keep their kids in private school.

Being too poor to go to a doctor when I had ulcerative colitis made me a big supporter of free health care, as well as appreciative of the life-affirming qualities in a good bowel movement. Two failed marriages and many failed relationships taught me the fine art of apologizing. A decade or so of professional failures proved that hardship builds character, just not a very good one. And then there's all the great things that happened. My children - despite years of fatherly neglect - turned out to be awesome. Shaking off a severe drop in revenue, the Jack Daniels company managed to limp along without me. I stumbled into an incredible career when I realized I had a better chance at becoming the next Sherwood Schwartz than the next Bruce Springsteen. So again, looking back, other than dying, I have no real complaints. Looking forward, well, if the lights in the chapel flicker... NOW!... it means I'm a non-corporeal spiritual entity with a delightful streak of mischievousness (more Spooky than Casper). If not, the likely scenario is I exist only in your memories, and, after the ceremony, as landfill in a Jewish cemetery. So, to sum up a lifetime: ""Here lies me. I did the best I could with what I had. I never stopped trying to be better. My flaws were plentiful. No need to list them here. We all know what they were -- don't we ladies? But I did love. And as I got older I think I learned how to love more. I hope that's what you remember about me.""""And that I was perfectly willing to end a heartfelt moment with a cheap dick joke.""",2015-04-16,"Big Bang Theory"
"Hardly  a  day  goes  by  when  I  don't  think  about  quitting  this business.  Hanging it up.  Taking my proverbial bat and ball and going  home.   In  my  imagination,  the  day  after  I  quit  is  a wonderful,  relaxing,  joyful  experience.   I  reconnect  with  old friends, walk on the beach, read, listen to music, play guitar, play  golf,  eat  leisurely  meals  off  of  real  plates,  exercise, meditate, maybe go see a matinee, or take a stab at writing a few pages  of  a  self-indulgent,  joke-free  play  filled  with  people screaming  at  each  other,  and  then,  after  taking  the  dog  for  a walk, climb into bed and fall into a peaceful, stress-free sleep.  The day after that, bored out of my mind, I start drinking around the clock and quickly descend into a dark, frothing madness that leads to either being institutionalized or liver failure and an agonizing,  premature  death.   The  really  scary  part?   There's hardly  a  day  goes  by  when  I  don't  think  about  quitting  this business. ",2011-10-03,"Big Bang Theory"
"I tried meditating on the beach today. After a few minutes of gazing out at the ocean these words floated up into my consciousness, ""An impersonal, life-creating vastness that is ever-changing."" The metaphor touched me deeply. It seemed as if time stopped, or at least was on hold. A feeling of peace came upon me, or more accurately, from within me. Then a new thought wafted, ""I am alive in an impersonal universe and I can't help but take it personally."" Then another thought, ""Life is sustained by eating other life. What's up with that?"" Then one more, ""Ever-changing is just a pompous way of saying $#!% happens."" Realizing I'd strayed from my meditation, I took a deep cleansing breath and once again looked out at the ocean. That simple joy and serenity I'd felt earlier returned immediately, followed by a new thought, or rather, sensation, ""I urgently have to urinate."" I looked around and saw no facilities. Not even a tree to hide behind. Desperate for relief, I looked back to the ocean and heard these words calmly whispered in my mind, ""Impersonal also means I will never judge you.""The water was cold, but I managed.",2015-04-02,"Big Bang Theory"
"Random Advice to Young Comedy WritersDon't eat a heavy lunch. It's bad luck to sit in a director's chair with your name on it. Good ideas feel good. They're almost gentle. Be suspicious of ideas you're really, really, really excited about - it might be a bipolar thing. Never stand up when pitching an idea, you're probably excited. There's no getting around it, some pants are luckier than others. Comedy written at three AM isn't as funny as you think it is. Comedy written at three PM when you're drunk isn't as funny as you think it is. Comedy written at three PM, stone cold sober, rested and well-fed might be funny. Might not. You want certainty in your profession, try accounting. If a show fails it doesn't mean you're a bad person. It just feels that way. Sleep with a retainer in your mouth to avoid grinding your teeth to dust. When the audience doesn't laugh, your soul is not being dragged out your ass. It just feels that way. With that in mind, don't be fooled by laughter that is simply an act of mercy. Mom may love you, but she is not a good barometer of your talent. With that in mind, if your mother truly loves you, you're probably not a comedy writer. Never watch someone read your script. Use this time to go to the bathroom and pass blood. Try and put the funny word at the end of the sentence. But sometimes don't. Again, Uncertainty is thy God. People who write poisonous things about your work are using up precious moments of their life dwelling on yours. These are moments they will never get back. Let that be a comfort to you. And finally, every time, without fail, your anger is really just your fear in disguise. The only reason you get angry is because you cannot tolerate fear. It's also why you have unlucky chairs and lucky pants.",2014-12-18,"Big Bang Theory"

"I recently found myself reminiscing about an incident that occurred almost thirty years ago. I had just landed my first job as a prime-time sitcom writer and was sitting in a room 'punching up' a script with a few other young writers and a couple of old pros, when one of the gray-haired, comedy mavens grumbled that the mediocre joke we were trying to improve was ""good enough"" and that we should ""move on."" He rationalized this by saying, ""No one will know the difference"" and, ""It's just a sitcom."" I remember being offended. I quietly promised myself that if I ever got a chance to write and produce my own series I would never think that way. I would never become so jaded and cynical that I squandered the opportunity to entertain people by assuming they ""won't know the difference,"" and by sneeringly regarding what I do for a living as being ""just a sitcom."" And I never have. But I have wondered what exactly is this thing I do. And I think I've finally figured it out. A sitcom is an extended conversation between writers, actors, directors and the audience. In success, the conversation goes on for years. Pre-internet, the viewers responded simply by watching or not watching. Now their opinions are loud, immediate and fully articulated. And it's great. And it's scary. But it's a real conversation between real people with real feelings. So we all need to choose our words carefully.",2015-02-26,"Big Bang Theory"

"The things I have spent my life depending on are undependable. Because they are things. And things are, by their very nature, subject to change. This applies to people as well. People change. People leave. Inevitably we all leave. The world, therefore, is essentially an unstable, uncertain environment. That's why I choose to believe in, and depend on, an unchanging, eternal, omnipresent non-thing. I prefer not to call it God, because the very word tends to thing things up. So I try not to call it. I try to experience it. Easy to do looking out at the ocean. Hard to do looking up at the ocean. Easy to do when you look at a baby. Hard to do if the baby is next to you on a long plane flight. Easy to do when you look at a pretty girl. Hard to do if you were once married to her. Clearly what blocks me from transcendence is judgment. If I were able to suspend having an opinion on drowning, other peoples' baby's vomit, and alimony, if I could simply see these things as they are - actions devoid of meaning until I give them meaning - I could experience some semblance of union with the infinite sublime.

"I believe in reincarnation. Not in the traditional sense. My feeling is that I have lived many different lives within this lifetime. I've also observed that each new incarnation came about after a period of intense physical and/or emotional pain. In other words, just like childbirth, it hurts to be born. Or reborn. A lot of crying happens. Death, illness, poverty, divorce, giving up a dream, waking up from a dream, getting fired, divorce again, substance abuse, being publicly ridiculed by a former friend - all these things have led to rebirth.

I still feel like I made the right choice. Sure, I might have welcomed a groundswell of support for me to rethink my decision. I mean, I have been writing these things for 18 years. You'd think it would mean more to people. But no. The general reaction to my announcement was mild disappointment followed by a shrug. A literal shrug. I actually saw several pairs of shoulders lift earward an inch or two. No one sat me down and pleaded with me to reconsider. Nor was there a celebration on my having achieved such a singularly unnecessary, non-literary achievement. If anyone felt the urge to reminisce about a personal favorite vanity card out of the FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY-THREE that I've labored over, they certainly didn't bring it up with me. No, the best I could hope for was shoulder spasms. One ""friend"" politely asked me what I'm going to do with all the free time I'll have now. I said that I planned on cultivating bitterness.

"We need to have a serious conversation about these vanity cards.   Before we start I just want to make clear that you've been great.  For something like eighteen years you've paused your VCRs and DVRs to read them.  Maybe you chuckled.  Maybe you shrugged.  Maybe one of them made a deep, positive impact on your life.  Or, more likely, made you want to mail me a letter dusted with anthrax.  Doesn't matter.  The important thing to remember is that this is not about you.  It's me.  Gimme a minute.  This is hard.  Okay, here it is... It's time for me to stop writing these things.  Now before you say anything, just hear me out.  The brash young man who liked to jerk a bony knee into the corporate ball sack is no longer brash nor young.  The smart aleck who once delighted in twisting the cultural nipple is not feeling so smart anymore, nor is he clear on what an aleck is.  And perhaps most telling, the smug word jockey who never missed an opportunity to tickle the establishment prostate sans Astroglide, now finds that metaphor offensive.

"I've been thinking about becoming a polytheist. No, this has nothing to do with missing Battlestar Galactica. And yes, I realize my blasphemous notion flies in the face of a few thousand years of ""Ye shall have no other gods before me."" (To be honest, even when I was a kid that commandment troubled me. It sounded like a jealous girlfriend saying, ""If I catch you looking at other girls, you're in big trouble, Mister!"" And don't get me started on how ""no other gods before me"" kinda implies that there might actually be some other gods loitering about.) But my main reason for considering becoming a Pagan (Pagish? Jewgan?), is that it neatly answers the age-old question, ""Why does god allow so much suffering in the world?"" When tragedy strikes, the monotheistic approach can only offer the tired old, ""It is not for us to question god's will."" Really? Why not us? Who else is in the questioning business? But look what happens when we ask the same question from a pantheistic perspective. Why do the gods allow so much suffering in the world?

"On what is perhaps the most bewildering experience of my life, I have, for the most part, chosen to remain silent. There have been times when it felt like I was actually swallowing my thoughts.

"I'm a big believer in the old maxim, ""If you don't ask, you don't get."" With that in mind, I'd like to throw caution to the wind and ask the Vatican's College of Cardinals to consider me for the job opening that recently became available. Now, before you say anything, let me be the first to point out the many reasons ""why not."" I'm Jewish. I've never understood the hoopla over the Old Testament, with all the smiting and begetting. I'm a twice- divorced sitcom writer with a shady past. And perhaps most importantly, I look silly in a hat. No argument, the cons are plentiful. But let's take a moment to examine the pros. First, I am completely untouched by the abuse scandal that is currently engulfing the church. I can stand on the balcony that overlooks St. Peter's Square and say to the adoring masses, with a straight, albeit Semitic face, ""Folks, I've never even met an altar boy."" With me as your pontiff you buy yourself some serious deniability. Next, believe it or not, I happen to be a very spiritually inclined guy. I would love a job where my primary thrust was encouraging prayer, meditation and acts of loving kindness. (Although in the interest of full disclosure, we would have to negotiate some common sense middle ground for any other thrusting I might want to do. It'd be a shame to waste adoring masses as long as they consist entirely of consenting adults.) And finally, there's the issue of my name. How can a billion true believers not smile and breathe a sigh of relief when the white smoke coming from the chimney is to announce the investiture of Pope Chuck? Cardinals, I want to assure you that while my papacy is a little ""outside the box,"" you can rest assured that I would passionately carry the good word to all the poor and the downtrodden, beginning with a holy visit to Saint-Tropez, or maybe the Bahamas or Turks & Caicos. And just think of the marketing opportunities! How is ""Pope Chuck"" not the name of the next Adam Sandler movie? What's to stop me from busting a move on the balcony and starting a dance craze called ""Pope Chuckin'""? And don't get me started on the demographic potential of a TV show entitled ""Pope Chuck, P.I."" (Kiss the ring, or get punched by it!) Yes, this transition represents an incredible opportunity for the church to be reborn. And at the end of the day, isn't that the name of the game?",2013-02-21,"Big Bang Theory"

"As I feel more and more alone, my phone confidently connects with everyone. As I feel more and more lost, my phone calmly knows how to get anywhere.

"According to futurist, inventor and all-around incredibly smart guy, Ray Kurzweil, human beings actually reorganize their frontal cortex as they pursue mastery over different skills. For example, a musician redesigns his or her brain by means of constant study, practice and performance. The same thing applies to a mathematician, carpenter and pole dancer. The brain is physically changed over time by activity and learning. This means we have direct influence and control over how our minds operate. This means we actually mold our perception of the world by the way we mold our brains. This means that over the last twenty-five years, I have reshaped my frontal lobe to do one thing, and one thing only -- write sitcoms. I can't tell you what a relief this knowledge is to me. To begin with, it single-handedly explains why I fail so consistently at other activities (golf, common courtesy and marriage come to mind). It also eases my fears about my disintegrating memory. Why would my brain waste precious neurons remembering where I put my glasses (on the top of my head), or the names of the camera crew (I think one guy is named John, or maybe Jamie or Nigel), when it's working overtime trying to structure a joke about a character masturbating like a meth-addled spider monkey? The answer is, it wouldn't. In other words, I have an advanced case of sitcom brain. On the plus side, I have been highly remunerated for my condition.

"I need to apologize. In an earlier vanity card I made a derisive comment about a popular reality show because I thought its premise - a group of single women compete with one another to win the affections of, and ultimately marry, an eligible man - was more threatening to the sanctity of marriage than gay people tying the knot. After careful consideration, I now realize that I couldn't have been more wrong. My mistake was that I was looking at the show through the tired old eyes of 60's feminism. But we are clearly in a post-feminist era. The patriarchal sexism that treated women as chattel and dictated how much they could earn or how much control they could have over their own bodies is a thing of the past, a curious relic of a dark, unenlightened time. Likewise, the idea that a woman without a man was somehow incomplete has long ago been consigned to the overflowing dustbin of humankind's misbegotten thinking. Women are now free to do anything they want, and that includes going on a reality show and using all their female wiles to snag Mr. Right.I really don't know what else to say except, ""I'm sorry and, um... you go, girl!""",2012-11-08,"Big Bang Theory"

"From what little I know of prehistory, man roamed the Earth for hundreds of thousands of years in small tribes -- probably no more than two hundred people per group.  During this time all wisdom was passed along according to the oral tradition.  Everything you needed to know in order to succeed as a human being was told and/or shown to you, whether it be how to find a girl, find a guy, have sex, have a baby, find food, raise children, deal with family, argue with neighbors, care for the sick, elderly and dead, fight, work, sing, dance, play and get really loaded in order to hookup with the universe.  (Side note: I've always loved the term ""prehistory,"" which arrogantly implies that prior to the emergence of our culture, nothing happened.)  Anyway, this state of affairs lasted for a long, long time.  It was relatively stable.  Peace on Earth, if you will.  Then, with the advent of large-scale agriculture and the need for ever larger swathes of land to accommodate it, the tribal system collapsed and people began to live huddled together in towns, villages and cities.  In short order, the priceless wisdom that taught us who we were and how we could live a happy life was forever lost to mankind.  Which brings us to today.  I don't believe that we became a neurotic and self-destructive species because we're born in sin, or otherwise flawed.  I believe our fall from grace was simply a forgetting.

"When I was in grade school we would regularly have atomic bomb drills. One of my favorites was clambering under our little wooden desks, quick like bunnies, so that we would be ""protected"" when the shock wave hit our big picture window and sent thousands of shards of glass shrapnel into our classroom. Equally helpful was the instruction to unbutton the top button of our shirts, remove glasses and take sharp items like pencils from our breast pockets. The logic being that collars could strangle us during a nuclear blast, glasses became just more shrapnel, and number two pencils could shish kabob our eight-year old hearts. Often we were ordered to line up, double file, hold our partner's hand (hopefully a girl, hopefully without a sweaty palm) and walk, don't run, down to the school's basement. There we would crouch next to a cold cement wall, thus ensuring our survival, or burial, in case the entire place got flattened. Interestingly, I don't recall there being any real concern about radiation poisoning other than how it might create Tokyo-stomping monsters. But probably my most vivid memory is of something that never happened. I had a recurring daydream which involved me neatly surviving the end of the world, climbing out of the rubble that was once Oak Drive Elementary School, and then running home to save the lives of my parents. Sadly, in none of my heroic fantasies was I able to rescue my older sister (we didn't get along that well, so it was probably for the best). The reason I bring all this up is I was thinking recently about how an almost daily reminder to a child that he or she might die in a terrifying explosion could cause a kind of post-traumatic syndrome. In a way, it made me feel a bit more forgiving to the monumental failings of the boomer generation. I also thought I should try and mend fences with my sister.",NA,"Big Bang Theory"

For  example,  I  recently  became fascinated with the rather routine word 'miscellaneous.'  To begin with, it really sounds great.  Miscellaneous.  I dare you to say it out loud and not smile.  Plus, you can just forget its meaning and have fun with it. ""Miscellaneous, miss a lot.""  Then consider its long journey from the Latin 'miscere' (to mix), to its current form. How did miscere become miscellaneous?  Whose idea was it to drop  the  'ere'  and  add  the  'ellaneous?'   And why?   Were they drunk?  Was it some sort of strange speech impediment that caught on with the general populace?  Or more likely, did the French get hold of it and decide to do what they do best - unnecessarily fancy it up?  Makes you think, right?  And speaking of the paths words take to arrive at their current form, how can anyone not be entranced  by  the  rocky  road  traveled  by  the  old  Germanic  word ' f i c k e n ' (to  move  back  and  forth)?

At thirty-nine  years  old  I  finally  woke  up  to  the  fact  that  the principles I was taught as a child, like fairness and justice, have no place in the world of power and money.  The rules of the sandbox, strictly enforced by a wise and compassionate adult, are laughable when the sandbox is the television business and there are Mercedes and Bentleys parked alongside it.  What's odd is that twenty years later, despite my belated awakening to the reality of amorality, that old schoolyard programming continues to insist on its rightness.   Ideas like ""play nice,"" ""share your toys,"" ""no name-calling,"" ""take turns"" and ""misbehaving gets punished"" still resonate  inside  me  as  if  they  were  some  sort  of  fundamental truths.   Of  course,  I  now  know  that  they  are  not.   At  best, they're ideals.   Lofty goals to aspire to.   The truisms of the real  world  are  more  along  the  lines  of,  ""my  ball,  my  bat,  my rules"" and ""money talks, bull$#*! walks.""  Which brings me to our impending presidential election.

I could see her as she slowly descended beneath the window frame. I could see him too. He just stood there smiling, like the canary who got eaten by the cat. But then a funny thing happened while I was dancing the voyeuristic bebop in my terribly trendy, bright-green plastic shoes.

No, this was the pain of existential separateness. The false sense that one is fundamentally apart from people, things, life, the whole damn universe.

As The Human Sponge, he had the ability to absorb the emotions of people nearby and make them his own - to the point of actually forgetting that what he was feeling did not originate with him.

"I  have  long  believed  that  we  as  human  beings  are  genetically inclined to elevate and worship those of us we deem to be very beautiful or very talented.   We do this because we are somehow comforted by our adoration.  It makes us feel good.  As children we sleep beneath the images of movie, TV, music and sports stars and  dream  about  the  mystery  and  grandeur  of  their  lives.   As adults, the posters come off the wall, only to be replaced by a steady,  noxious  stream  of  tabloid  culture.   But  perhaps  most enjoyable of all is watching the fall from grace.  Nothing beats a good ol' public crucifixion.  Especially when it's self-inflicted.  My theory for why this is considered entertainment is, again, a genetic one.  DNA, even if it's mediocre, wants to ensure its own survival.   The existence of superior DNA is viewed as a threat.  When beautiful and talented people screw up, we can't help but feel  that  this  somehow  improves  the  chances  for  our  mediocre descendants to eat meat.  In other words, evolution my ass.

"Every night before going to bed, he would brush his teeth and make a preemptive attempt to void his bladder.  He then walked into his closet, got on his knees in front of the shoe rack and prayed to a god  whose  unlikely  existence  he  likened  to  an  ongoing  quantum event.   In his mind, the act of kneeling mattered not at all to this supposed god.  He could just as well pray standing naked on his head with his ass serving as a fleshy vase for a bouquet of flowers.  The penitential pose was only useful as a demonstration of his humility in the face of the infinite (although when things were  going  his  way,  it  was  more  of  a  feigned  humility).   The prayers  themselves  mostly  consisted  of  thanking  his  sub-atomic almighty verb for assembling an infrastructure that allowed for life to exist.  This included, in no particular order, the various laws of physics, gravity, organic chemistry and thermodynamics.  And, since it was his belief that sentient life was created by an insentient  universe  in  order  for  the  insentient  universe  to  be admired, he made an effort in his prayers to tell the insentience, ""nice work"" or ""way to go"".  Finally, he would close with a plea for this nameless everything to look after the less fortunate.  ""Please  god,  despite  the  clear  evidence  that  it's  not  in  your nature  to  care,  bring  love  and  happiness  to  all  the  souls  who suffer.""

Strong Nielson ratings guarantee employment, not self-esteem.Actors can smoke cigarettes because they're immune to carcinogens. It's safe to talk openly and honestly with people because they'renot really listening.The two major groups in TV show biz are, naturally enough, showpeople and biz people. Telling them apart is simple. No matterhow old they are, 'show' people (usually creative types likewriters, actors, directors and musicians) dress like teenagers.Again, regardless of age, 'biz' people  (agents, managers,lawyers, company executives) dress like adults.  When 'biz' peoplestart dressing like 'show' people it means they've made too muchmoney off the backs of the aforementioned 'show' people.

Sometimes, when I read the very unkind things written about that show, I'll remember the words of a sleazy music manager I was briefly associated with back in my rock 'n' roll days. The guy was right out of central casting. Bald, middle-aged, pot-bellied and sucking on a cheap cigar, he would sit behind his metal desk in his ratty little office and pontificate to dumbass musicians hungry for career guidance. One of his speeches has remained vivid in my memory for thirty-five years. He said, to a soon-to- be-nonexistent, dumbass power trio I was then a part of, ""Boyz, if halfs da peoples loves ya, and halfs da peoples hates ya, you're a star!"" At the time I had no idea what he was talking about. It wasn't until fifteen years later when I was writing for a TV show called Roseanne that I figured it out. I was once again reminded of all this when the star of the show I was talking about earlier came out for a curtain call in front of a packed studio audience. They went wild with applause.

Wild and carefree dancing that celebrates your incredible and well-deserved success is only allowed on New Year's Eve, and only with a sober celebrity parasitic flunky to lean on.         6.

"Zen and the Art of Sitcom I have been writing sitcoms for twenty-five years. During this time, I have learned a few things.  Practical things. Do's and don't's if you will. For instance, do hire actors based on talent not looks. Somewhere between take eight and take fifteen, you will be hating both yourself and the gorgeous, but clueless ingenue who got the job because she looks exactly like what you imagined the character looks like... or worse, like the kind of woman you could live happily ever after with. Don't waste time with a marginal joke that forces the actor to twist him or herself into a pretzel in order to make funny. It's much better to work a little harder and write a great joke that the actor can do in their sleep. This also allows the actor to be well-rested when it comes time to renegotiate his or her contract. Do try to be kind to the power players. The movers and shakers. The people who tell you how to do your job.  After they fail in network TV, they will remember you fondly while they're busy tanking fledgling internet companies. But perhaps more important than do's and don't's is learning to trust in the mysterious power of intuition.  The soft inner voice that guides you to a better outcome than experience and logic could ever provide. This is what I call the Zen of Sitcom. The willingness to allow transcendence to play a part in the making of a TV show. Try it sometime in your own job. It can be the source of great inspiration.  A word of warning though: it's not foolproof.  If your business collapses or you wind up getting fired, you're probably hearing the same voice I listened to when I created Grace Under Fire, Cybill and four or five TV pilots that now function as landfill. If it's possible, try not to listen to that one.  As inner voices go, it's kind of a douche.",2010-10-28,"Big Bang Theory"

"Over the years, CBS executives have always been very generous when it comes to sharing their ideas as to how I might better do my job.I have never returned the favor regarding how they might run their network. Until now. Now I have a really good idea. Step One: Createan internal division with workers who do nothing but check out the claims of prospective advertisers. And I mean really check themout. If it's a car, have somebody drive it around to see if it accelerates into walls or slow-moving pedestrians for no particularreason. If it's beer, have someone drink it and report back if it gets them laid. If it's a pill, have someone take it for awhile,then wait to see if they grow a tail, get anal leakage, or commit suicide. Step Two: Quality control. All commercials must beaesthetically pleasing, seriously funny, poignant, or dramatic. Any commercials deemed loud, stupid and/or obnoxious are not aired.Period. No exceptions. Step Three: Tell the world that CBS only airs the coolest and most honest commercials. It's always SuperbowlSunday at CBS! Step Four: Watch the money roll in. A Final Thought: Don't worry about the initial loss of income created by droppingthe dumb stuff (e.g. Cockney lizards who sell insurance).

"I worked for Stan Lee twenty-five years ago at Marvel Animation in Los Angeles. Myfavorite memory is sitting in his office with the legendary Johnny Carson writer, BobSmith. We were discussing an animated series featuring Rodney Dangerfield as “a dogthat got no respect.” (Bob was the actual brains behind the project, I was justhanging around hoping to be included.) Anyway, the meeting was going along nicely, theidea of creating an unloved mutt modeled on Rodney seemed both poignant and hilarious.Then Stan rose from the throne-like seat behind his desk and said, “what thisproject needs is a real comedy writer.” I looked over at Bob, one of the whitestguys you’ve ever seen, and watched him get even whiter. I glanced down and saw hisfists curl into bloodless mallets. A cold, eerie silence filled the room. It felt as iftime had stopped. I remember thinking I’m about to see a legendary Johnny Carsonwriter kill the guy who invented Spider- Man. And then the oddest thing happened.

"Belarus is a small, land-locked country next door to Russia,Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. According to Wikipedia,one of its major exports is cattle by-products. Which begs thequestion, what horrible shape are the cattle in, if all they'regood for is felt hats and wallpaper paste? But Belarus does havea bustling TV production industry.

The characters are named Sheldon, Leo,Hovard, Raj and Natasha, and the show is entitled, The Theorists.Each episode begins with a rapid-fire montage of images whichtakes us from the dawn of time to the present moment. Keepingwith that theme, the montage is scored with what is probably theworst piece of recorded pop music since the dawn of time.

"ASK CHUCK!Dear Chuck,At a recent dinner party, I found myself in an awkward situation when the host, a devout atheist, sneezed between spoonfuls of his gazpacho. Without thinking, I said, ""God bless you."" He gave me a withering look and said, as if to a child, ""Golly gee, I sure hope he does."" The other guests exploded with laughter, while I imploded with humiliation. To avoid future embarrassment, what is the correct response when an atheist sneezes?Troubled with ahchooDear Troubled,First, a little background information. Saying ""God bless you"" following a sneeze is thought by some to have originated in the sixth century in order to protect the sneezer from falling ill to the bubonic plague. Another possible origin is that people once believed that the devil entered the body during a sneeze and saying ""God bless you"" could help ward him off. Since the plague has killed something like two hundred million people and the words ""God bless you"" have, in all likelihood, been said countless times to Glenn Beck, we can safely assume the phrase has no real power against germs or demonic possession. What it does contain is simple human courtesy -- a means by which we express concern for one another. As to how to respond to a sneezing atheist, well, that's easy. Simply say, ""Sounds like you're coming down with something, I hope you don't die and rot in a box.""",2010-02-01,"Big Bang Theory"
"I have coined a new word which I'm hoping will catch on. The word is ""fuv."" Fuv came about due to my frustration with the phrase, ""making love,"" specifically its inability to capture the wonderfully lusty, grunting nature of the act. I was also unsatisfied with the mono-syllabic Anglo-Saxon word commonly used to describe intercourse. That word failed miserably at describing the deep spiritual and emotional bonding that can occur during sex. But now with my new word, couples engaged in that most intimate of human activities can look into one another's eyes (assuming they're facing one another) and whisper the simple, all-encapsulating phrase, ""I fuv you."" And yes, they can do all that while listening to my new album of remakes of classic pop hits, including, ""If Fuving You Is Wrong, I Don't Wanna Be Right,"" ""I Feel Like Making Fuv,"" and the immortal, ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" featuring the lyric, ""I'm gonna fuv you, like nobody's fuved you.""",2010-01-18,"Big Bang Theory"

"I have long believed that part of our problem with resolving race issues in America is our inability to accurately name what we are. Aside from the occasional Johnny and Edgar Winter, there are no white people. Any child with a box of crayons can tell you that white people are, in fact, beige. The sickly ones are gray. Following this crayon logic, one can easily see that there are really no black people. They are brown. Or perhaps raw umber. Or maybe burnt sienna. Frankly, every time I hear someone comment on America's first black president, I can't help thinking, ""No, he's not. He's more like caramel."" Which is why I think we should all get in the habit of calling each other what we really are. How can you racially slur a man by calling him ""beigey"" or ""umber?"" The answer is you can't.

People nearby glanced at me nervously. Then, as the movie was about to begin, I got a tickle in my nose and sneezed. Twice. The young couple sitting to my left immediately got up and moved across the aisle. The old lady directly in front of me leapt to her feet and literally vaulted over her husband in order to sit further away from me. For some reason, I was a little miffed. But then I realized the newfound power I had. I got up, crossed closer to the old lady and young couple and coughed again. They all glared at me and once again moved their seats. The game was on! Maneuvering like a knight on a chess board, I countered their move by moving two rows down and one seat over. I looked at them. I smiled. I coughed. They were stunned. How could this be happening? How had their simple movie outing turned into an Edgar Allan Poe short story? But it had! In a matter of minutes, they had become Prince Prospero and his noble cohorts, while I, I had become the Red Death! The old woman covered her mouth and nose with her hand and cried out, ""Why are you doing this to us?!"" I laughed and said, ""Why? You want to know why? Because death, my dear woman, is the inevitable end for us all! And there is no hiding from it. Even at the AMC!"" A horrible silence hung over the theater, no one moved, no one breathed.

"The following is an excerpt from my keynote speech at the 2009 SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY WRITERS OF AMERICA NEBULA AWARDS.When I was 12 years old, my teenage sister had a boyfriend whom my parents lovingly named ""Cross-Eyed Larry."" In my official capacity as the ""obnoxious little brother,"" I took it upon myself to annoy and harass poor Larry at every opportunity. In fact, I specifically learned to cross my eyes so I could welcome him to our home with the appropriately juvenile comedic flair. (My mother constantly warned me that if I didn't stop doing that my eyes would stay crossed. In hindsight it appears as if she was lying or, at best, misinformed.) Anyway, my speech tonight is a long overdue attempt to make amends for my childish pestering and cruelty towards this polite young man whose only discernible character flaw was a poorly-aimed libido (no way he was getting over on my sister). But even more than an amends, I needed to find some way to thank him. And here's why: way back in 1964, Larry did something that would change my life forever. In order to get rid of me so he could stick his tongue down my sister's throat, Larry gave me a dog-eared copy of Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles. His plan worked brilliantly. The book not only turned my prepubescent, Hardy Boys world upside down, it would begin my lifelong love affair with science fiction. Unfortunately, Cross-Eyed Larry was not so lucky. Ultimately rejected by my sister, he descended into a life of drugs and crime that ended tragically when he was murdered in Attica State Prison because another inmate thought he was looking at him funny.",2009-05-11,"Big Bang Theory"

I can't tell you how many mornings I groggily walked around in my pajamas searching for its cause. Frustrated by my inability to locate the source of the banging, I falsely accused my ancient refrigerator and began seeking a replacement. But then I caught a break. Rising early one morning for reasons urinary, I stumbled across the real source of the strange noise -- a small, yellow-breasted bird living in a tree next to the kitchen window. Periodically, he would fly to the window, furiously peck at it with his beak, then quickly retreat to a nearby branch. At first I assumed that the morning light caused him to see his reflection and, being of limited intelligence, or filled with self-loathing, attack it. But once again, my initial instinct proved to be wrong. After a long conversation with the bird, I learned that he was banging on the window because he had it in for my refrigerator.

"I believe that Newton's first law of motion is the reason we will emerge from our current economic woes. That law states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. How does that relate to the financial #$%*storm we're now cowering under? Allow me to explain. There are slightly less than seven billion people on this planet. Assuming that roughly half that number are either too young, too old, too lazy, or too loaded to work, that still leaves almost three and a half billion people getting up in the morning to chase the almighty dollar, the transcendent rupee, the zen yen,the dear ol' euro, the what's goin' on yuan, the... well, you get the idea.

I therefore assert that the unbalanced force (you know who you are, shame on you), will eventually be overwhelmed by the object in motion (three and a half billion people with pluck, aka pluckers), thus allowing the object in motion to continue its relentless journey forward, thriving and conniving until it is once again slowed down by other unbalanced forces, or a very large meteorite.

The particular example Sheldon quotes is the inverse Tangent function, or Arctangent, which has two asymptotes. If you graph it, it sort of looks like a horizontal S:No matter how big you make x (that is, how far you move to the right), the function is never going to hit that top line (π/2), and no matter how small x gets (moving to the left), y is never going to be smaller than - π/2.The more you know, the funnier it gets.",2009-01-19,"Big Bang Theory"

If the article is to be taken seriously, and God knows, why wouldn't any sensible person take it seriously, that means there are currently nineteen people in the TV biz who are smarter than me. Now I'm just thinking out loud here, but if something were to happen to those nineteen people... if say, they were to, one by one, have horrible accidents, or mysteriously disappear, then that would make me, ipso facto, the number one smartest person in television.

"NOVEMBER 16, 2008As I sit by my window and watch the leaves on the trees turn from green to brown, and from brown to fire, I can't help but reflect on the two seasons of Southern California. Inferno and flood. Soon the stinging smoke, raging wildfires and inevitable pyromaniacs will give way to months and months of biblical rain. And with that rain will come the memories... a home perched on a hilltop becoming garbage nestled in a valley, an idiot falling into the L.A. River and trying unsuccessfully to crawl up its cement banks, another genius being lifted off the roof of his car by a helicopter in Encino, the cliffs above Pacific Coast Highway collapsing yet again and causing Malibu residents so much inconvenience, Bob Myer reassuring me that writing the second act of a Roseanne episode at two in the morning is more in my self-interest than trying to drive home and move my stuff to the second floor (but more likely becoming one of the knuckleheads standing on the roof of his car praying for a chopper). But I, as is my nature, whataya gonna do, I yam what I yam, digress. Eventually the rains will stop, the underbrush will grow, the drought will come, the drought will linger -- maybe for years, until the mountains and hillsides once again explode with ""Live At Five"", ""Film at Eleven"" hellfire, and thus continue the cycle of seasons of Southern California... if you don't count earthquakes and riots.

"We have once again arrived at a moment in history where the truth can be defined as ""that which you can make other people believe."" The methodology for creating that belief is repetition.

I am endowed like a stallion. And also why a state run television news channel is so very dangerous. I am endowed like a stallion. Now there are those who would argue this has already happened and that a certain cable news channel is actually a covert extension of our government. I am endowed like a stallion. The fact that the channel is run by a high-ranking party official, an anchor person from the channel became a White House spokesman, and another top-ranking party official became an on-air news commentator is often used to make this argument.

"Friday morning, October 10, 2008Watching the market fall as precipitously as the hopes and dreams of NBC and ABC executives, I can't help but think that there are two bets I can make right now. One is on the simple inertia of a world economy created by hundreds of millions of people creating and servicing stuff that other people need and want. The other bet is on canned goods and guns. Since I've never actually fired a weapon and I'm not sure where my can opener is, I've decided to go with bet number one. If I'm wrong and the market continues to descend like a drug-addled hooker with vertigo, it's reasonable to assume that any new world order created by the complete collapse of the free market system will have little use for a comedy writer.

"On a recent trip to Las Vegas I watched a grim, beer-bellied man row a gondola filled with tourists through the ""canals of Venice."" This was his job. At some point he had to have filled out an application and undergone an interview process to determine if he had the necessary skills to be a pretend gondolier eight hours a day, five days a week. As he glided past me I found myself imagining him walking into his house at the end of a long day, tossing his keys into the cheap ceramic bowl by the front door and sadly calling out to his wife, ""I'm home."" To which she would cheerfully respond, ""How was work today, sweetie?"" But instead of saying ""fine,"" which was how he answered that question every other day, he paused and considered the days' events, and all the events that had led him to this point in his life. Then he crossed to the hall closet, took down a shoe box from the hat shelf, removed a small caliber pistol that he'd bought for home protection, and immediately blew his brains out all over the badly framed photograph of him rowing Barry Manilow. Waking from my brief reverie, I found myself suddenly filled with compassion and respect for this stranger of the inland sea. Compassion for his quiet desperation. And respect that he chose not to take his cheerful wife with him.I don't know about you, but Vegas always does this to me.",2008-10-06,"Big Bang Theory"

"I think we can all agree that the cliche, ""no pain, no gain,"" is a fundamental truth. When we experience physical pain in the gym, we gain muscles and stamina. When we endure hardship and sacrifice in order to succeed, we gain a feeling of satisfaction and achievement, not to mention financial rewards. When we truly embrace emotional pain, we gain compassion for the suffering of others, an appreciation for the fleeting nature of things, as well as wisdom and spiritual humility. Every act of birth is an act of pain. Our very lives are sustained by the suffering and death of plants and animals, who in turn are sustained by other organisms having a very bad day. That being said, I think we can also agree that this system sucks and needs to be seriously re-jiggered. Now I'm not saying I have a better approach than this pain/gain thing that's been in place for millions of years -- but that doesn't mean we couldn't start tossing around some ideas. For instance, why couldn't an infrastructure for life be developed around the theme, ""no dream, no gain?"" Sounds like heaven, right? Or is dreaming too easy? Would life quickly become complacent and cease to gain? But then, is gain really that critical? Or is gain the whole point? Is the fact that life exists at all proof that God or the universe hates complacency? It certainly explains why aboriginal people are constantly being murdered for the sake of ""progress.""

"Tonight's story about Sheldon's ego being crushed following his encounter with a young prodigy has its roots in my own life. Around 1974 I was playing guitar for a living in Miami Beach. I was twenty-two years old and thought I was really something. In the parlance of musicians, I felt I had some ""serious chops."" Nights I played clubs, hotels, and private parties. For a few months I worked in a lounge band on a cruise ship. I even landed a day gig playing acoustic solo stuff at a coffee house in South Beach. That was where a professor from the University of Miami saw me play, dug what I was doing, and invited me to audit his jazz guitar class at the university. I happily accepted, thinking I might be able to teach the kids a thing or two. I still remember the first class, me sitting in the back proudly holding my beat-up '64 Fender Strat, while the college students all cradled expensive Gibsons. Of course, this only made me feel more smug. I was a working musician. These were rich kids in a rich school with instruments that daddy bought 'em. But then something happened that would change my life forever. A painfully shy, sixteen year old boy walked into the room. He could barely speak nor make eye contact with anyone, seemed dwarfed by his big jazz guitar, and was ludicrously introduced as a visiting professor to the university. His name was Pat Metheny. I'll never forget how I felt when he began to play. It was an imploding feeling, like the kind you get when your ego is being demolished like an old Vegas casino. Thankfully, the feeling was accompanied by a soft, reassuring voice in my head that whispered, ""Find work in television, nobody's a prodigy there."" Thirteen years later I listened to that voice (I may have been deluded, but I was no quitter). Oh, and Pat, if you happen to read this... thank you.",2008-04-14,"Big Bang Theory"
"Two hundred vanity cards. I have now amassed a body of work that can safely be called ""pointlessly unique."" In the history of literary efforts, there has never been a literary effort quite like this one. Okay, literary might be pushing it, but I don't think I'm engaging in hyperbole when I say that it's highly unlikely my achievement will ever be duplicated, let alone surpassed. Why? Well, most show creators who are awarded the hallowed, second-and-a-half, end-of-episode ""hey everybody, look at me!"" card, have better things to do. Those that have no life (a goodly number), are simply not compelled to vomit up weekly offerings of painfully personal, petty, mock-metaphysical, self-congratulatory, rage-filled, and regretfully sarcastic essays that occasionally haunt them forever. Sure, non-showrunners can write a weekly essay of no particular value. But for it to be considered a true vanity card, it must be attached to the ass end of a television show. And let's keep in mind I've made a lot more shows than vanity cards. There were many weeks on Dharma & Greg and Two and a Half Men when I was too wasted (mostly in the literary sense) to write something coherent. Anyway, I wanted to use this momentous card to celebrate my accomplishment because, well... no one else was jumping up to do it. Two hundred cards! Boy, oh boy, that is really something...

"ZEN NOIRThe hardest journey is the one which leads to the truth. I didn't know that when I began my little midnight ramble. If I had, I probably would've stayed home, drank myself stupid and watched Ferguson until the big nod closed my book for the day. But there I was, standing outside her house, looking up at her bedroom window while a cold rain whipped me in the face like I'd somehow pissed it off. I could see her kissing him. I could see her as she slowly descended beneath the window frame. I could see him too. He just stood there smiling, like the canary who got eaten by the cat. But then a funny thing happened while I was dancing the voyeuristic bebop in my terribly trendy, bright-green plastic shoes. I found myself thinking that the aching loneliness I was feeling had its roots in something much deeper than being eighty-sixed to a one bedroom efficiency in the marina by a dame who digs deep into the degrading bang-bang in order to make up for an emotionally distant father. No, this was the pain of existential separateness. The false sense that one is fundamentally apart from people, things, life, the whole damn universe. In a blinding flash I realized that what I was really experiencing was the result of a life-long indoctrination by a culture which elevates individualism above all else, thus causing a soul-crushing sense of aloneness which demands over and under the counter medication, the constant distraction of sporting events, TV, major motion pictures and a pop-tabloid religion based on celebrity worship/crucifixion.

"Back when I was writing and producing Dharma and Greg, the only way to read my cards was to record each episode on a VCR and hit the ""pause"" button. This was not an easy task. The image wobbled like crazy making the tiny words of my weekly tomes very hard to see. Then it hit me. What about building a device that records video images digitally? Wouldn't this allow for a much more precise ""pause"" function? I took my little notion to an impoverished computer whiz by the name of Schlomo Tivowitz. At the time of our meeting Schlomo was feverishly trying to invent an improved version of the George Foreman Grill. Schlomo's grill would contain a hard drive that remembered all the details of your last barbecue, as well as an address book. I didn't really see the point of it, but, not being a tech guy, I held my tongue and presented him with my idea. I will never forget his reaction. With hamburger-flecked spittle flying from his blubbery lips, he laughed, called me some very unkind names and demanded that I leave his mother's basement immediately.

Over and over, I have consciously entrapped myself in difficult situations and relationships and then struggled to get free. Which leads me to wonder, is this cycle the very essence of existence?

People leave. Inevitably we all leave. The world, therefore, is essentially an unstable, uncertain environment.

"Random Advice to Young Comedy WritersDon't eat a heavy lunch. It's bad luck to sit in a director's chair with your name on it. Good ideas feel good. They're almost gentle. Be suspicious of ideas you're really, really, really excited about - it might be a bipolar thing. Never stand up when pitching an idea, you're probably excited. There's no getting around it, some pants are luckier than others. Comedy written at three AM isn't as funny as you think it is. Comedy written at three PM when you're drunk isn't as funny as you think it is. Comedy written at three PM, stone cold sober, rested and well-fed might be funny. Might not. You want certainty in your profession, try accounting. If a show fails it doesn't mean you're a bad person. It just feels that way. Sleep with a retainer in your mouth to avoid grinding your teeth to dust. When the audience doesn't laugh, your soul is not being dragged out your ass. It just feels that way. With that in mind, don't be fooled by laughter that is simply an act of mercy. Mom may love you, but she is not a good barometer of your talent. With that in mind, if your mother truly loves you, you're probably not a comedy writer. Never watch someone read your script. Use this time to go to the bathroom and pass blood. Try and put the funny word at the end of the sentence. But sometimes don't. Again, Uncertainty is thy God. People who write poisonous things about your work are using up precious moments of their life dwelling on yours. These are moments they will never get back. Let that be a comfort to you. And finally, every time, without fail, your anger is really just your fear in disguise. The only reason you get angry is because you cannot tolerate fear.

"I believe that the much argued ""sanctity of marriage"" ended in 1960 when the FDA approved the birth control pill for contraception.  In other words, the minute science allowed women to take charge of their reproductive cycle, the cultural reason for protecting marriage - ensuring the continuation of the species - collapsed. Additionally, when conception became a fundamental female choice, as opposed to a random event, thousands of years of patriarchal rule came to an end.  That is why male-dominated religions and social institutions are so filled with rage right now. They know, at least subconsciously, that the jig is up. Their tribal blood-drenched reign is over.  We are witnessing the death throes of the testosterone epoch.

"Not that it really matters, but the joke I made at the ProducersGuild Awards regarding Ben Affleck's genitals being of sufficient size to fill the caped crusader's codpiece was just that, a joke. I've never met Mr. Affleck in or out of a men's room. Nor am I in the habit of peeking at another guy's junk while standing at a urinal. (I mostly stare at the tiles and worry that the invisible auto-flush light beam is secretly cooking my internal organs.) I just wanted to open my speech with a cheap laugh about the Golden Globes. To be completely honest, the original version of the joke had me peeing next to and peeking at Martin Scorsese -- who was, at best, a grower not a show-er. I cut it, wisely I thought, because it felt unfair to ""belittle"" a giant of cinema, even if I had issues with ""Hugo."" I then considered telling the same joke with Harvey Weinstein as the celebrity at the neighboring stall, but cut that as well because I worried that he might be able to have me hurt. It was only when I thought of Mr. Affleck that it finally hit me. If I'm going to make up stuff about another man's penis, why not go positive? Embellish his endowment if you will. It's still funny. And it also allowed me to work in the Comic-Con Batman angle. Win-win right? Wrong. While the joke did score at the PGA event, it got way too much traction afterward. Which is why I now feel the need to set the record straight. You want to know if Affleck is man enough to be Bruce Wayne? Ask his wife. Or, if you're feeling man enough, rent ""Daredevil.""

"Confession.  Outside of a small cadre of friends, family and coworkers, I have become hopelessly incapable of remembering people's names.  I don't know if it's due to stress, exhaustion, age or an extra-terrestrial parasite devouring my frontal lobe, but I am fighting a losing battle to retain names.  I've tried and failed to overcome this using mnemonic devices.  (Most memorably when I played golf with a man named Cooney.  In order to remember his unusual name I mentally associated it with George Clooney.  As we teed off, I repeated quietly in my head, ""Clooney, Cooney.  Clooney, Cooney.""  I was feeling pretty good about my efforts until the sixth hole when Cooney asked me why I kept calling him George.)  Another aspect of my retention dysfunction comes when I'm being introduced to someone.  I literally black out while the person's name is announced.  (My solution for this is to feign hearing loss, which seems less embarrassing than admitting to temporary unconsciousness.)  To make matters worse, I'm constantly worrying that people who greet me by name will think I'm being rude or dismissive when my best response is a feeble, ""Hey, man"", or the ever meaningless, ""Hey, how ya' doin'?""  It's gotten to the point where I'm truly frightened by my befuddlement.  Which is why I'd like to propose a simple solution.  When you see me, point to your head and say your name over and over again.  If, when next we meet, I greet you with, ""Hey, good to see ya!"", repeat the process.

"I've been thinking about becoming a polytheist. No, this has nothing to do with missing Battlestar Galactica.

It sounded like a jealous girlfriend saying, ""If I catch you looking at other girls, you're in big trouble, Mister!"" And don't get me started on how ""no other gods before me"" kinda implies that there might actually be some other gods loitering about.) But my main reason for considering becoming a Pagan (Pagish? Jewgan?), is that it neatly answers the age-old question, ""Why does god allow so much suffering in the world?"" When tragedy strikes, the monotheistic approach can only offer the tired old, ""It is not for us to question god's will."" Really? Why not us? Who else is in the questioning business? But look what happens when we ask the same question from a pantheistic perspective. Why do the gods allow so much suffering in the world? Because outside of their particular area of expertise: farming, war, fertility, what-have-you, they are not even remotely in control. The buck stops nowhere. (In this scenario both the Old Testament and New Testament deities are off the hook as far as your general suffering is concerned.) But here's the really good news: with a polytheistic approach to prayer we can micro-target our beseeching. Trouble with love? Take it to Aphrodite. Not catching enough fish? Poseidon.

With that in mind, I'd like to throw caution to the wind and ask the Vatican's College of Cardinals to consider me for the job opening that recently became available. Now, before you say anything, let me be the first to point out the many reasons ""why not."" I'm Jewish. I've never understood the hoopla over the Old Testament, with all the smiting and begetting. I'm a twice- divorced sitcom writer with a shady past. And perhaps most importantly, I look silly in a hat. No argument, the cons are plentiful. But let's take a moment to examine the pros. First, I am completely untouched by the abuse scandal that is currently engulfing the church. I can stand on the balcony that overlooks St. Peter's Square and say to the adoring masses, with a straight, albeit Semitic face, ""Folks, I've never even met an altar boy."" With me as your pontiff you buy yourself some serious deniability. Next, believe it or not, I happen to be a very spiritually inclined guy. I would love a job where my primary thrust was encouraging prayer, meditation and acts of loving kindness. (Although in the interest of full disclosure, we would have to negotiate some common sense middle ground for any other thrusting I might want to do. It'd be a shame to waste adoring masses as long as they consist entirely of consenting adults.) And finally, there's the issue of my name. How can a billion true believers not smile and breathe a sigh of relief when the white smoke coming from the chimney is to announce the investiture of Pope Chuck? Cardinals, I want to assure you that while my papacy is a little ""outside the box,"" you can rest assured that I would passionately carry the good word to all the poor and the downtrodden, beginning with a holy visit to Saint-Tropez, or maybe the Bahamas or Turks & Caicos. And just think of the marketing opportunities! How is ""Pope Chuck"" not the name of the next Adam Sandler movie? What's to stop me from busting a move on the balcony and starting a dance craze called ""Pope Chuckin'""? And don't get me started on the demographic potential of a TV show entitled ""Pope Chuck, P.I."" (Kiss the ring, or get punched by it!)

"According to futurist, inventor and all-around incredibly smart guy, Ray Kurzweil, human beings actually reorganize their frontal cortex as they pursue mastery over different skills. For example, a musician redesigns his or her brain by means of constant study, practice and performance. The same thing applies to a mathematician, carpenter and pole dancer. The brain is physically changed over time by activity and learning. This means we have direct influence and control over how our minds operate. This means we actually mold our perception of the world by the way we mold our brains. This means that over the last twenty-five years, I have reshaped my frontal lobe to do one thing, and one thing only -- write sitcoms. I can't tell you what a relief this knowledge is to me. To begin with, it single-handedly explains why I fail so consistently at other activities (golf, common courtesy and marriage come to mind). It also eases my fears about my disintegrating memory. Why would my brain waste precious neurons remembering where I put my glasses (on the top of my head), or the names of the camera crew (I think one guy is named John, or maybe Jamie or Nigel), when it's working overtime trying to structure a joke about a character masturbating like a meth-addled spider monkey?

In an earlier vanity card I made a derisive comment about a popular reality show because I thought its premise - a group of single women compete with one another to win the affections of, and ultimately marry, an eligible man - was more threatening to the sanctity of marriage than gay people tying the knot. After careful consideration, I now realize that I couldn't have been more wrong. My mistake was that I was looking at the show through the tired old eyes of 60's feminism. But we are clearly in a post-feminist era. The patriarchal sexism that treated women as chattel and dictated how much they could earn or how much control they could have over their own bodies is a thing of the past, a curious relic of a dark, unenlightened time. Likewise, the idea that a woman without a man was somehow incomplete has long ago been consigned to the overflowing dustbin of humankind's misbegotten thinking.

"Divine Intervention(Part Two - Continued from ""The Big Bang Theory"")Richie slowly opens the door a crack. Sees nothing. Opens it a bit more. He hears a groan coming from his right. On hands and knees, Richie crawls out of the shed to his left, finds one of the bad guys dead of gunshot wounds. How'd that happen? He crawls in the opposite direction and stumbles on the other bad guy. This is the groaner, dying from gunshot wounds, drowning in his own blood. The two idiots managed to shoot each other. The dying man sees Richie and tries to grab for his dropped weapon. Richie removes it from his reach and prepares to shoot him but... he can't do it. Not easy to pull the trigger on another human being when you just heard the voice of God -- and that God saved your ass. Richie lowers the gun and says to the man, ""Okay, well, good news, there is a God. I know 'cause I just spoke with him."" The guy stares at him, helpless, incredulous. Richie continues, ""I asked him to help me out, he said okay, and voila, you and your partner shoot each other instead of me. I mean, it's weird that God helped me and not you. Maybe if you prayed for help killing me. I don't know. I hope it doesn't work that way. The point is you're gonna die, but hey, you're gonna meet God -- who may or may not be glad to meet you 'cause, you know, you're a bad guy. Oh sure, I'm a bad guy too, but apparently there's a sliding scale, grade on a curve kinda thing, or maybe I just have some kind of upside potential and you obviously do not."" The man coughs up blood and dies. Richie quickly says, ""Okay, say hi to God for me. Tell him I said thanks.""Richie runs off a changed man, no longer a dope-dealing hustler, a common thief. For the rest of his life he will dedicate himself to spreading the word: a loving God not only exists, he answers our prayers. We stay in the backyard and pan to an open upstairs window of the house.

"I'm reluctant to use my vanity cards to plug the sale of my vanity card book. That doesn't mean I won't do it, I'm just reluctant. Or perhaps the better word is ambivalent - of two minds. On the one hand it seems a bit shameless to ask people to spend money on a beautifully bound, giant coffee table book filled with amusing stories and biting witticisms, each high-gloss page handsomely illustrated and ready for framing. On the other, it sure would make a dandy holiday gift for that special someone in your life who already has an iPod Nano. Of course, the fact that the book contains some original material which is sure to stir up some old controversies is by no means reason to buy it.

"From what little I know of prehistory, man roamed the Earth for hundreds of thousands of years in small tribes -- probably no more than two hundred people per group.  During this time all wisdom was passed along according to the oral tradition.  Everything you needed to know in order to succeed as a human being was told and/or shown to you, whether it be how to find a girl, find a guy, have sex, have a baby, find food, raise children, deal with family, argue with neighbors, care for the sick, elderly and dead, fight, work, sing, dance, play and get really loaded in order to hookup with the universe.  (Side note: I've always loved the term ""prehistory,"" which arrogantly implies that prior to the emergence of our culture, nothing happened.)  Anyway, this state of affairs lasted for a long, long time.  It was relatively stable.  Peace on Earth, if you will.  Then, with the advent of large-scale agriculture and the need for ever larger swathes of land to accommodate it, the tribal system collapsed and people began to live huddled together in towns, villages and cities.  In short order, the priceless wisdom that taught us who we were and how we could live a happy life was forever lost to mankind.  Which brings us to today.  I don't believe that we became a neurotic and self-destructive species because we're born in sin, or otherwise flawed.  I believe our fall from grace was simply a forgetting.  Speaking of which, don't forget to buy my book of vanity cards, which is chock full of wisdom-rich oral tradition -- that inadvertently got written down -- and can be preordered online right now!

"When I was in grade school we would regularly have atomic bomb drills. One of my favorites was clambering under our little wooden desks, quick like bunnies, so that we would be ""protected"" when the shock wave hit our big picture window and sent thousands of shards of glass shrapnel into our classroom. Equally helpful was the instruction to unbutton the top button of our shirts, remove glasses and take sharp items like pencils from our breast pockets. The logic being that collars could strangle us during a nuclear blast, glasses became just more shrapnel, and number two pencils could shish kabob our eight-year old hearts. Often we were ordered to line up, double file, hold our partner's hand (hopefully a girl, hopefully without a sweaty palm) and walk, don't run, down to the school's basement. There we would crouch next to a cold cement wall, thus ensuring our survival, or burial, in case the entire place got flattened. Interestingly, I don't recall there being any real concern about radiation poisoning other than how it might create Tokyo-stomping monsters. But probably my most vivid memory is of something that never happened. I had a recurring daydream which involved me neatly surviving the end of the world, climbing out of the rubble that was once Oak Drive Elementary School, and then running home to save the lives of my parents. Sadly, in none of my heroic fantasies was I able to rescue my older sister (we didn't get along that well, so it was probably for the best). The reason I bring all this up is I was thinking recently about how an almost daily reminder to a child that he or she might die in a terrifying explosion could cause a kind of post-traumatic syndrome. In a way, it made me feel a bit more forgiving to the monumental failings of the boomer generation. I also thought I should try and mend fences with my sister.",NA,"Two and a Half Men"

"I like words.   I like the way they sound, I like their subtle shades  of  meaning,  their  power,  and  most  particularly,  their ancient  roots,  their  origins.   For  example,  I  recently  became fascinated with the rather routine word 'miscellaneous.'  To begin with, it really sounds great.  Miscellaneous.  I dare you to say it out loud and not smile.  Plus, you can just forget its meaning and have fun with it. ""Miscellaneous, miss a lot.""  Then consider its long journey from the Latin 'miscere' (to mix), to its current form. How did miscere become miscellaneous?  Whose idea was it to drop  the  'ere'  and  add  the  'ellaneous?'   And why?   Were they drunk?  Was it some sort of strange speech impediment that caught on with the general populace?  Or more likely, did the French get hold of it and decide to do what they do best - unnecessarily fancy it up?  Makes you think, right?  And speaking of the paths words take to arrive at their current form, how can anyone not be entranced  by  the  rocky  road  traveled  by  the  old  Germanic  word ' f i c k e n ' (to  move  back  and  forth)?   Was  it  first  used  in carpentry?  ""Grab the other end of this saw and we'll ficken it across this log.""   Or is it the Teutonic ancestor of 'fickle'?  ""First you say we should sack Rome, then you say we shouldn't.  Boy, you are one ficken barbarian.""

"I'm going to let you in on a powerful secret.  A secret so big, once you know it, your life will never be the same.  Okay, here it is: Buy the problem, buy the solution.   Got it?   No?   Alright, fine,  lemme  break  it  down  for  you.   If  someone  can  devise  a problem  and  convince  you  that  it  is  the  cause  of  all  your troubles,  then  they  can  sell  you  a  solution.   And  here's  the kicker: If you really believe in the problem, the solution will actually work.  For example: If you can be conned into thinking that the reason you're unhappy is because your body is encrusted with evil spirits (the problem), there is an organization that will, for a very reasonable price (considering your dilemma), free you  of  the  pernicious  little  devils  and  make  you  feel  like  a demigod  (the  solution).   The  same  holds  true  with  the  thorny thicket proposed by another, more established  institution: If you can be made to believe that your life is in ruins because you were ""born in sin"" (the problem), then salvation is just a donation away (the solution).  On a secular level, if you can be convinced that the reason you're miserable is because a black guy wants you to get health insurance (the problem), then relief is available through a small campaign contribution (the solution).  Got it now?  Buy  the  problem,  buy  the  solution.   Here's  one   created  by  a pharmaceutical company: She's ready, but he's not (the problem), which forces him to buy a pill to ensure that he's always ready (the solution).  This one amuses me because the company assumes it's his problem.  But it could just as easily be hers.  Why not sell her a pill?  Maybe something to make her less ready.",2012-04-16,"Two and a Half Men"
"For me, the epiphany came in my second season on Roseanne.  At thirty-nine  years  old  I  finally  woke  up  to  the  fact  that  the principles I was taught as a child, like fairness and justice, have no place in the world of power and money.  The rules of the sandbox, strictly enforced by a wise and compassionate adult, are laughable when the sandbox is the television business and there are Mercedes and Bentleys parked alongside it.  What's odd is that twenty years later, despite my belated awakening to the reality of amorality, that old schoolyard programming continues to insist on its rightness.   Ideas like ""play nice,"" ""share your toys,"" ""no name-calling,"" ""take turns"" and ""misbehaving gets punished"" still resonate  inside  me  as  if  they  were  some  sort  of  fundamental truths.   Of  course,  I  now  know  that  they  are  not.   At  best, they're ideals.   Lofty goals to aspire to.   The truisms of the real  world  are  more  along  the  lines  of,  ""my  ball,  my  bat,  my rules"" and ""money talks, bull$#*! walks.""  Which brings me to our impending presidential election.  A classic showdown between the lessons we all learned as children and, well... reality.  Further complicating the situation is our collective, unconscious desire to be supervised by that wise and compassionate adult.  But there is no such adult.  The truth is, we are alone in the sandbox.  The game we play, seemingly forever, is called ""Ideals vs. Money and Bats.""

"I believe that we have a cultural obsession with things getting better. Corporate profits MUST rise. Gross domestic product (whatever the hell that is) MUST go up.Teenage pregnancies, smoking related deaths, the deficit and unemployment numbers MUST go down. Well, clearly no one else wants to ask the question, so I will. Why? Why MUST life constantly improve? When did we become so burdened with this need for things to always get better? I'm pretty sure that if we go back in time far enough we'll find that our ancestors didn't stress over it. Life was good, then it was bad, then it was the same, then it got good again, etc. For millions of years, things rarely got great and often got horrible. Which is why I believe our relentless drive to improve on the status quo is a fairly recent occurrence. Furthermore, I pinpoint its origin with Darwin's Theory of Evolution, which I believe mistakenly implies that it's in the nature of nature to ""get better."" We all know the deal, amino acids improve to amoebas, which improve to jelly fish, blah, blah, blah, homo sapiens (assuming evolution ends with us, which it doesn't).

The shipping label no longer has any relationship with what's in the box.

There's your name in an article or some blog, and then, far away, in some other place - or no place if you're feeling zennish - is you.

To successfully write a rantone would need to use a lot of foul language and a small army ofexclamation points. Any casual reading of my cards would, Ibelieve, suggest quite the opposite. I have always steered clearfrom hyperbolic venting, preferring to make my case in subtle,understated ways. In fact, if any one word were to be used todescribe my weekly missives, I think it would be ""stealthy."" Orperhaps ""subversive."" If I were to use two words, I might go with""winkingly clever."" But ""rant""? I hardly think so. Even theregrettable card from several years ago in which I suggested thatmany TV critics would gladly eat a hole through their loved onesin order to tunnel toward a real job in show business, was more ahumorous observation than an outpouring of vitriol. And myfrequent aggravation toward CBS censorship? Please. That's justa little game we play. Funny jokes are killed off by corporateexecutives in dead-end jobs and lawyers who are unwilling orunable to actually practice the law, while I make a show ofcomplaining. Theater of the Absurd perhaps, but not a rant. Toexperience the real thing I would suggest watching video of majorleague baseball managers disputing calls by umpires, or Fox News.Now those are rants. In the meantime, I will continue to calmlyoffer my opinion regarding the world as I see it, right here afterTwo and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and Mike&Molly. If, forsome reason, my detractors find that unacceptable, I will notstoop to using ugly words and exclamation points. Winkinglyclever requires inference.

"Did You Know?Mental images can stimulate the human brain with the same power as events that are actually occurring. If this were not the case we could not argue with long dead relatives or masturbate. In Bob Dylan's classic song ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" the title character is urged to ""play a song for me.""  The extreme difficulty one might face trying to play a song on a tambourine is never dealt with. The greeting ""Hey, how are you?"" is a popular method of saying hello. The person using it is not really interested in your current state of being. A way to punish them for this deception, and ensure it never happens again, is to answer, ""Not so good, I just had an accident in my pants. Can you accompany me to the bathroom and help me tidy up?""",2010-11-08,"Two and a Half Men"

"I have to assume that there's an evolutionary advantage to having a brain which keenly remembers the bourbon-soaked magic carpet ride, but not its puke-on-the-shoes, please-God-help-me-find-my- car aftermath.  The same holds true for romantic relationships.  The dreamy, eye-gazing moment of transcendent intimacy is recalled with perfect clarity, while the sleepless nights on a bed with enough room between the two of you to park a car is but a dim memory.  My theory for this mental preference is that the brain is hard-wired to push the organism toward pleasure and away from pain.  It's actually designed to cherish the good times and discard the bad.  I can't think of another explanation for why I'm always amused by the ""drink responsibly"" tag at the end of alcohol commercials.  Sure.  What other way to drink is there?  It also explains why, whenever I call my lawyer, he starts the conversation with ""please tell me you're not getting married again.""",2010-10-25,"Two and a Half Men"

"GOLF IN THE KINGDOM   PART TWO According to press reports, the fatal orgasm had cost him seventy- five million dollars. Not surprisingly, he tried to make himself feel better about it by doing a little mental amortization.  His wife had only caught him the one time, but during the course of their marriage he'd probably had about one hundred illicit encounters with miscellaneous cocktail waitresses, pole dancers and bitter real estate agents. These encounters led to, best guess, one hundred and fifty orgasms. Running the numbers that way, he was able to whittle his per orgasm costs down to roughly five hundred thousand dollars a piece.

"When I was a child I was taught the saying, ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" At the time, I saw the sense of it. Words, being intangible, have no ability to inflict physical harm. Whenever another child said something mean to me, I would loudly recite the saying at them, using it like a magical incantation that would protect me from getting my feelings hurt. I usually said it with tears running down my cheeks. As an adult I've come to see that the saying is, like many things taught to children, a lie. The truth is that bones heal, while the damage done by words can last a lifetime. I bring it up here only to remind those who write about television of the power they wield. And that is the power to wound with words. The power to be mean. They have absolutely no power to affect ratings and the likely success or failure of a TV show. In that arena they are laughably impotent.  Unengorged.  Limp.  Flaccid, if you will.  Forever poking, but never really penetrating. But I should tread carefully here. I don't want to now become the very thing I decry.  One who uses words to hurt.

"Over the years, CBS executives have always been very generous when it comes to sharing their ideas as to how I might better do my job.I have never returned the favor regarding how they might run their network. Until now. Now I have a really good idea. Step One: Createan internal division with workers who do nothing but check out the claims of prospective advertisers. And I mean really check themout. If it's a car, have somebody drive it around to see if it accelerates into walls or slow-moving pedestrians for no particularreason. If it's beer, have someone drink it and report back if it gets them laid. If it's a pill, have someone take it for awhile,then wait to see if they grow a tail, get anal leakage, or commit suicide. Step Two: Quality control. All commercials must beaesthetically pleasing, seriously funny, poignant, or dramatic. Any commercials deemed loud, stupid and/or obnoxious are not aired.Period. No exceptions. Step Three: Tell the world that CBS only airs the coolest and most honest commercials. It's always SuperbowlSunday at CBS! Step Four: Watch the money roll in. A Final Thought: Don't worry about the initial loss of income created by droppingthe dumb stuff (e.g. Cockney lizards who sell insurance). You'll more than make that money back by demanding that your high-qualityadvertisers cut you in for a piece of their action. You have, after all, earned it by giving them the CBS seal of approval.

"Last Christmas I visited Hong Kong. This was my first trip to Asia and the cliché""sea of humanity"" was never far from my mind (at times it was so much in myconsciousness, it crowded out other clichés like, ""never kiss a prostitute on themouth."") Anyway, there are a lot of people there. And one day, while walking through acrowded marketplace, I found myself thinking that every one of these people has a story.Each individual in this endless, teeming throng has experienced joy, heartache, success,failure, fury, and despair. They've all struggled with love, money, work, family, friends,illness and death. Just like the actual sea contains an endless array of living organisms,this ""sea of humanity"" contains an infinite number of unique, poignant, hilarious andtragic stories.

"ASK CHUCK!Dear Chuck,At a recent dinner party, I found myself in an awkward situation when the host, a devout atheist, sneezed between spoonfuls of his gazpacho. Without thinking, I said, ""God bless you."" He gave me a withering look and said, as if to a child, ""Golly gee, I sure hope he does."" The other guests exploded with laughter, while I imploded with humiliation. To avoid future embarrassment, what is the correct response when an atheist sneezes?Troubled with ahchooDear Troubled,First, a little background information. Saying ""God bless you"" following a sneeze is thought by some to have originated in the sixth century in order to protect the sneezer from falling ill to the bubonic plague. Another possible origin is that people once believed that the devil entered the body during a sneeze and saying ""God bless you"" could help ward him off. Since the plague has killed something like two hundred million people and the words ""God bless you"" have, in all likelihood, been said countless times to Glenn Beck, we can safely assume the phrase has no real power against germs or demonic possession. What it does contain is simple human courtesy -- a means by which we express concern for one another. As to how to respond to a sneezing atheist, well, that's easy. Simply say, ""Sounds like you're coming down with something, I hope you don't die and rot in a box.""",2010-02-01,"Two and a Half Men"
"I have coined a new word which I'm hoping will catch on. The word is ""fuv."" Fuv came about due to my frustration with the phrase, ""making love,"" specifically its inability to capture the wonderfully lusty, grunting nature of the act. I was also unsatisfied with the mono-syllabic Anglo-Saxon word commonly used to describe intercourse. That word failed miserably at describing the deep spiritual and emotional bonding that can occur during sex. But now with my new word, couples engaged in that most intimate of human activities can look into one another's eyes (assuming they're facing one another) and whisper the simple, all-encapsulating phrase, ""I fuv you."" And yes, they can do all that while listening to my new album of remakes of classic pop hits, including, ""If Fuving You Is Wrong, I Don't Wanna Be Right,"" ""I Feel Like Making Fuv,"" and the immortal, ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" featuring the lyric, ""I'm gonna fuv you, like nobody's fuved you.""",2010-01-18,"Two and a Half Men"

The young couple sitting to my left immediately got up and moved across the aisle. The old lady directly in front of me leapt to her feet and literally vaulted over her husband in order to sit further away from me. For some reason, I was a little miffed.

Maneuvering like a knight on a chess board, I countered their move by moving two rows down and one seat over. I looked at them. I smiled. I coughed. They were stunned. How could this be happening?

"OFFICIAL BIOGRAPHYI was born in a women's prison in Mississippi. My mother was serving a life sentence for shooting her boyfriend's roommate. According to court documents, her defense was, ""I was aiming at my boyfriend."" My father was a prison guard who would later in life write and illustrate a children's book about a rooster who enjoyed the attention of many chickens. The book was short-listed for a Newbery Award. I was taken from the prison and sent to live with my maternal grandparents who eked out a meager living selling bathtub thalidomide to circus folk. My early years were uneventful except for being forced to stay up way past my bed time in order to ""keep an eye out for angry circus folk."" Desperately unhappy as a teenager, I was sent to a therapist who determined that I was possessed by deeply disturbed spiritual beings that had been imprisoned in a volcano billions of years ago and then blasted with hydrogen bombs by an evil alien warlord. After the twisted spirits were successfully purged from my body, my depression magically vanished, only to be replaced by self-loathing, arrogance and ulcerative colitis. This, of course, provided a natural segue into my current life as a twice-divorced sitcom writer. As a footnote, one of the tormented beings pulled from my body went on to unsuccessfully run NBC for several years.",2009-09-28,"Two and a Half Men"

"For months I've woken up to a mysterious, intermittent banging sound coming from somewhere in my home. I can't tell you how many mornings I groggily walked around in my pajamas searching for its cause. Frustrated by my inability to locate the source of the banging, I falsely accused my ancient refrigerator and began seeking a replacement. But then I caught a break. Rising early one morning for reasons urinary, I stumbled across the real source of the strange noise -- a small, yellow-breasted bird living in a tree next to the kitchen window. Periodically, he would fly to the window, furiously peck at it with his beak, then quickly retreat to a nearby branch. At first I assumed that the morning light caused him to see his reflection and, being of limited intelligence, or filled with self-loathing, attack it. But once again, my initial instinct proved to be wrong. After a long conversation with the bird, I learned that he was banging on the window because he had it in for my refrigerator. I have since apologized to the fridge, but it has been, not surprisingly, cool towards me.Sorry, that really wasn't worth the journey.",2009-04-27,"Two and a Half Men"
"More and more, it seems like people are yelling at me. This is especially noticeable on local and cable news, TV and radio ads, morning, afternoon and late night talk shows, religious channels, entertainment tabloid shows, and, NPR aside, radio. It's almost as if all the news anchors, reporters, product pitchmen, talk show hosts, politicians, sportscasters, DJ's and preachers have forgotten how good modern microphones are. Regardless, the purpose of vanity cards is not just to point out the problem, it's also to propose the solution. And here's one: The Whisper Channel. A cable news channel where everyone, including advertisers, speaks in gentle, dulcet tones. Our marketing tag line will be one word, ""shhh."" Instead of grinning, shouting, overly-coiffed failed actors, our news anchors will be regular folks with beautiful speaking voices who, just to be on the safe side, have been heavily sedated.

You crawl into your home which is worth far less than you paid for it, and, because you want to stay informed, you turn on The Whisper Channel where a pleasant-looking woman with real hair, real nose, real wrinkles, real breasts and teeth the color of teeth, soothingly tells you about the latest terrorist attack, stock market fiasco, school shooting and, just to keep it interesting, emergency recall of the anti-anxiety meds you've been taking because they might cause impotence, blindness and insanity.

"I believe that Newton's first law of motion is the reason we will emerge from our current economic woes. That law states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. How does that relate to the financial #$%*storm we're now cowering under? Allow me to explain. There are slightly less than seven billion people on this planet. Assuming that roughly half that number are either too young, too old, too lazy, or too loaded to work, that still leaves almost three and a half billion people getting up in the morning to chase the almighty dollar, the transcendent rupee, the zen yen,the dear ol' euro, the what's goin' on yuan, the... well, you get the idea. Now, call me crazy (and many have called me far worse), but I happen to think that three and a half billion motivated people is one big damn object in motion. And the only thing acting against that object is the friction caused by a small bunch of greedy, dumbass, screw-the-pooch, Ivy League pot stickers (the unbalanced force). I therefore assert that the unbalanced force (you know who you are, shame on you), will eventually be overwhelmed by the object in motion (three and a half billion people with pluck, aka pluckers), thus allowing the object in motion to continue its relentless journey forward, thriving and conniving until it is once again slowed down by other unbalanced forces, or a very large meteorite.

"In 1970 I enrolled at the State University of New York at Potsdam under my given name, Charles (Chuck) Levine. I lasted two years. Most of my memories are of playing guitar in rock bands at bars and frat parties (Casey Jones, Whipping Post, Southern Man, Aqualung), trying desperately to get coeds to wrap their legs around my 27 inch waist, learning to juggle, playing frisbee, Zig-Zag rolling papers, repeatedly listening to Voodoo Chile, and playing acid chicken with my roommates (the game involved who could watch their face melt in a mirror the longest without suffering a full-blown psychotic break). Oddly, I have only two memories of actually being in class. One in which my pupils were inordinately dilated and the professor was rude enough to notice, and the second when the alcoholic bastard who taught creative writing mocked my work and informed me I'd never make it as a writer because my grammar was awful. I only bring this up because someone at my old alma mata figured out I was once Chuck Levine, contacted me and offered me an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree along with an invitation to speak at this year's commencement ceremony. Thrilled and proud to finally have a college degree, I immediately accepted. In fact, I have already begun writing a speech which I hope will prove inspiring to the fresh-faced graduates.

If he did die, they would happily hire an attorney, sue me and become wealthy. Cute, right?

"Hey, Chuck, what do all those TV writing credits mean?I'm glad you asked. The first credit you see on the screen is story editor. It's worth noting that story editors don't edit stories. Their main job is to exist in a constant state of paranoia about being fired because no one sees how brilliant they are. An executive story editor is a story editor with a cool-sounding word added to their title. In order to qualify as a story editor, one must have spent some time as a lowly staff writer. Interestingly, staff writer is the only writing credit that actually has the word ""writer"" in it. It is also the only credit that does not appear on the screen. I'm told that this curious lack of acknowledgement was devised by The Writers' Guild. The writing credit above story editor is co-producer. No aspect of the show is produced by the co-producer. Next up we have producer. Again, nothing about the show is produced by a producer, but if they aren't fired they're pretty much guaranteed becoming a supervising producer. One would think there'd be some supervision or producing at this level. One would be wrong. Climb the ladder another rung and you reach co-executive producer. This is usually a talented writer who has endured years of emotional punishment for creative input, an office with a window, infertility and/or premature baldness. Then there is the consulting producer. Consulting producers are usually former executive producers who are willing to work for less than their usual fee but don't want anyone to find out. Finally, at the top of the TV food chain, is the executive producer. The executive producer is either the creator/head writer who will die of a massive heart attack trying to supervise every aspect of production, a co-executive producer who was conned into dropping the ""co"" from their title in lieu of money, the star, the star's boyfriend, the star's manager, or a former network executive who fell ass backwards into a pot of gold.",2008-04-28,"Two and a Half Men"

In this case the head's up was that CBS was going to stream several episodes of Two and a Half Men on their web site.

"SITCOM SPIN-OFF IDEA FOR THE SOPRANOS""Paulie and the Cat""Reeling from the assassination of his beloved leader, Paulie Walnuts tries to vent his anguish by whacking the pesky cat that hangs around the Bada-Bing. After hitting the cat with a shovel, Paulie throws its limp, little carcass into a plastic garbage bag and drives it to the East River for disposal. But wouldn't you know it, at the very last second a tiny ""meow"" is heard from inside the bag. Paulie is torn. Should he spare the determined feline, or toss him into the polluted waters that separate two great states? Uncomfortable with ambivalence, Paulie flies into a rage and begins shooting at the bag. But wouldn't you know it, once again a sad ""meow"" escapes from the generic store brand plastic prison that is neither Glad, Hefty or Ziploc. His psychotic fury spent, Paulie mumbles a misogynistic curse in Italian and frees the cat. But wouldn't you know it, the cat, his tiny head slightly caved in, his patchy fur matted with blood, curls up in Paulie's arms and begins to purr. Thus begins a tale of love and laughs for the whole family as Paulie and the cat become inseparable goombahs and dependable earners. Paulie never once suspecting that the ""hit"" placed on him, was put there by his furry, little partner. But wouldn't you know it?",NA,"Two and a Half Men"

"I love golf. I find it to be a terrific workshop for dealing with the everyday problems of life. The problem that most comes up for me in golf is fear. Fear of looking foolish, fear of choking, fear of scoring badly, fear of scoring well, fear of letting down a playing partner, fear of hitting it in the water, the sand, the street, the snack bar, the woods, dead left, dead right, two feet in front of me, or into the soft head of an innocent child at play. Fear causes my mind to race and my muscles to tighten. The swing that follows causes my opponents to smirk and count my money. Golf teaches me that I cannot suppress the fear, nor think my way out of it. My only option is to acknowledge it and swing anyway. This is a lesson that I have tried to apply to my work. Every day I make a conscious effort to gracefully accept my fear of being judged as inadequate, my fear of letting down people who count on me, my fear that I have nothing of consequence to write about, my fear that no one will watch the show because they'd rather watch mediocre celebrities dance, my fear regarding the welfare of my children, my fear that my sister will never talk to me again, my fear that I will die alone, my fear that the mole on my leg is melanoma, my fear that aneurysms happen without warning, my fear of global warming, bird flu, random violence and dirty bombs -- and work anyway. The result has been astonishing. I believe my work is better than ever. I have also tried to apply this golf lesson about fear to my dealings with women. No luck so far.

"This week, as a little bonus for all my loyal vanity card readers, I thought I'd give an inside look into the making of Two and a Half Men by telling you about a joke CBS insisted we cut from the final scene in tonight's show. The scene, as I'm sure you remember, involved Charlie finding Alan, post-coital, tied to his bed, and wearing nothing but a bustier and red nylons. The offending line in the scene was what we in the comedy biz refer to as a ""callback"" since it references a line that was said earlier in the episode (in this case two lines, the first being when Alan's date implies that she hopes to spend the night with him by coyly saying ""I brought a toothbrush with me,"" and the second, when Alan tells Charlie that ""that lady in there brought a toothbrush with her because I have a penis and a job!""). Now before I tell you the joke which was cut, it's important to point out that I'm not doing this to make a point about censorship. In this particular case we never felt unfairly edited. The excised joke was, without question, in terrible taste and we didn't even try to defend it. But we did think it was funny. In any case, here it is: In the original, uncensored final scene, Charlie nonchalantly exits the bedroom without untying his hapless brother. Alan reacts with astonishment and calls out, ""Charlie?... Charlie?! This isn't funny! Come back!... At least take out the toothbrush!"" When we shot this version our studio audience laughed loud and long. Our CBS censor's head exploded, injuring several writers standing nearby.",2007-02-12,"Two and a Half Men"

"I have always been a literal and linear writer. For better or worse, when I put words on paper, my mind seeks logic and clarity. I think this is the reason my song-writing career peaked at, ""They're the world's most fearsome fighting team, they're heroes on a half shell and they're green."" But more importantly, my creative defect has caused me to live with a dirty little secret -- I don't really get classical or pop poetry. When Bob Dylan sang, quite assertively, that ""the answer was blowin' in the wind,"" I knew it was not. The only thing blowin' in the wind was wind, dirt, leaves and miscellaneous crap light enough to become temporarily airborne. Not that I could share this with anyone. It was not for me to question the voice of my generation. But privately I always thought it would have been a better song if he simply told us what the 'answer' was. (""How many roads must a man walk down, before they could call him a man?"" Nine. Six if he jogs.) The reason I bring this up is that I aspire to break free from the confines of logic. I yearn to write thought-provoking, surrealistic sojourns into the realm of the unfettered spirit. I dream that just once, the muses will infuse my soul with graceful poetry that speaks to the heart.

"A Scientific Theory for Male PromiscuityFor obvious evolutionary reasons, strange causes a chemical to be released in the brain that makes a man feel good. He is thus driven to seek out strange. Unfortunately, this euphoric brain excretion quickly becomes ineffective because strange is only strange once (although with alcohol and some creativity, its strangeness can be lengthened, sometimes for several years). Nevertheless, eventually strange ceases to be strange, which forces the brain, designed over millions of years to avoid pain and locate pleasure, to find new strange. Scientists disagree as to when this simple evolutionary mechanism created the mutation known as divorce lawyers, or why the entire concept is not accepted by the formerly strange as a good reason for sleeping with her sister.",2006-05-22,"Two and a Half Men"

"People often ask me, ""Chuck, where do the ideas for Two and a Half Men come from?"" Well, the answer is very simple. Tonight's show, for instance, was inspired by many of the great films that have been out recently. Two handsome young cowboys share a hidden love that society condemns. A love that torments them and presumably requires a lot of lubrication. A brilliant homosexual author is not tormented about being homosexual but drinks a lot and is tormented while writing a book about tormented men who have killed people. A brilliant and tormented country singer is tormented until he stops drinking and finds the love of a good woman who is not tormented. A brilliant TV news man is tormented by his moral obligation to stand up against a tormented bully. A spy is tormented by the corruption and deceit that lies beneath the politics of oil (a lubricant). A cross-section of Los Angelenos are tormented by the endless cycle of racism that lies beneath the surface of Los Angeles. An Israeli soldier is tormented by the endless cycle of violence that lies above the surface of the Middle East. And finally, a big monkey is tormented because he loves a really small woman, who, if their love were to proceed, no amount of lubricant would help. Now, if you go back and review tonight's episode you'll see that both Charlie and Alan were tormented. See how it works? The lubrication stuff we're saving for sweeps.",2006-01-01,"Two and a Half Men"

"WARNING TO MALE VIEWERS!Despite the comic conceit of tonight's episode, ingesting ""semi-lethal quantities of alcohol"" in order to overcome the deep-seated fear that women will reject you, is a terrible idea. We, the producers of Two and a Half Men, do NOT recommend it. If you are struggling with this fear we strongly urge you to seek healthier solutions. A few to consider are: Becoming handsome. Becoming rich. Becoming a famous musician, actor, writer, director or artist. Becoming a famous athlete. Becoming a brooding loser who is also handsome. Becoming funny. Becoming thin. Becoming old. Becoming apathetic. Becoming a woman. Becoming a college professor. Becoming a religious leader. Becoming psychotic (this allows one to achieve the steely confidence bestowed by alcohol, but without the attendant liver damage). Having really big muscles and hanging around simple women. Having drugs and hanging around women who are addicted to them. Having food and hanging around hungry women.

I pause for a moment to determine whether there's any value in writing about mechanical versus digital clocks, then decide there isn't. The pressure builds. I pause again to drink a protein shake that my wife insists is good for me. Once again I stop to consider if there's something comedic to be mined here. Maybe a fantasy card about how she's trying to poison me. No. She reads these things, probably not wise to give her any ideas. I keep thinking how this is just like my entire academic career. Waiting until the last minute to do my homework. It is now 11:45. I've asked for more time. It's not helping...The dog ate my vanity card.Two and a Half Men",NA,NA

"As we go about our day, as we sleep peacefully in our warm beds, a battle is raging. A battle between the forces of darkness and the forces of light, between those who seek chaos and those who cherish and defend order. Many brave and good men have taken on this eternal struggle, but there is only one who has never bent, never hesitated to do what needs to be done. He is a rough, violent man who risks his own soul so that the rest of us may safely live out our lives in ignorant bliss. He seeks no credit. There are no medals, nor parades for men such as he. He fights for us and then, weary and bloodied, he returns to a life of simple anonymity, writing and producing a sitcom for CBS. Who is this soldier? His name does not matter. But you can be sure of one thing, he wouldn't mind a freaking Emmy nomination once in awhile. And he could probably hit evil people on the head with a Golden Globe.Two and a Half Men",NA,NA

Is someone misbehaving in a dog-like fashion? Eleven years old: The Beatles come to America. I deeply understand the obsession to hold a girl's hand, but more importantly, I notice that girls willingly throw the less accessible parts of their bodies at skinny musicians.

"I believe that there is an unspoken contract between those who purport to make comedy and those who watch comedy. That contract states that in exchange for the viewer's time and attention, he or she will experience the simple joy of laughter. Anything less constitutes a breach of contract. We've worked very hard to hold up our end of the bargain. We hope you've laughed. We certainly have. For those of you who have not fully given us your time and attention, we would expect you to do better in the future. Talking to loved ones while the show is on, even if it's to comment on the show, means you're not really holding up your end. Try waiting for the commercials to discuss specific jokes and startling plot developments. Another thing to look out for is eating loud food that gets in the way of hearing all the dialogue (this includes eating in a hurry so your dinner will be fully digested before the folks at CSI Miami start poking at cadavers). Needless to say, all phones must be shut off and toilet visits are allowed only if clothing, furniture and slow-moving pets are threatened. In such cases, viewers are encouraged to leave the bathroom door ajar so they can still hear the show (men are advised to pee on the porcelain part of the bowl to reduce unnecessary ""stream"" noise). If the above demands seem onerous, please keep in mind that we have entered into an unspoken comedy contract.

"Last night I dreamt that Ellen DeGeneres was inexplicably hot for me. We were at some sort of party where she told her friends that she found me irresistibly sexy and that, despite being a lesbian, she wanted to do me. As for myself, I was torn. I'm a big fan of Ellen's. She's incredibly smart and funny, not to mention cute as the proverbial button and sassy as the equally proverbial all get out. I think my ambivalence stemmed from being confused about why, given her sexual orientation, she would be interested in me. Anyway, as the dream progressed Ellen made advances toward me that were, well... very sensual. My ambivalence did not stop me from doing a little smooching and copping a feel. She has a great body. Very lithe. And that was the end of the dream. Or all I could remember. Ellen, if this vanity card should get to you, please know that your passion for me was a beautiful and natural thing.

"There was a scene in this episode which was drastically cut down in order to appease the censors. Their problem with it was the length of time we spent on the nude back of an attractive young woman. My problem is knowing that I work in an industry, or perhaps I should say a culture, that is more comfortable showing a dead naked body than a live one. A glimpse at any of the prime-time police procedural shows reveals that the powers that be, both in Hollywood and Washington, are perfectly at ease with graphically detailed autopsy scenes that show female corpses being carved up in order to reveal the titillating (pun intended) cause of death, or, if it's during sweeps, examined for traces of semen. Now I don't for one second believe that this little vanity card vent of mine will accomplish anything. I even strongly doubt that, despite living in a country that espouses ""free speech"", it will even be broadcast. I just needed to get it off my very alive, and very sexual chest. (p.s.

"THREE UNFINISHED VANITY CARDSI haven't played guitar professionally in twenty years and I'm still haunted by a recurring dream where I find myself playing in a rock band on an instrument I don't know how to play -- usually drums, tenor saxophone or a Hammond B-3 organ. The organ dreams are the least frightening. I hold down chords for an inordinate amount of time, swoop my hands up and down the keys like Greg Allman and hope no one notices.I recently told a TV reporter that I need to feel love for my work in order for the quality of the work to rise to a level that has any merit. I surprised myself with this comment. Most of my life my work has been motivated by my fragile, child-like ego. If I do good work, people (okay, women) will like me. Is this a sad, Freudian mommy thing? Probably. It sure attracted a lot of women who were more than happy to mommy me. But that's not what I want to talk about.The act of writing is often a painful ordeal for me. This got me to thinking; what would happen if I began from a place of simple, unabashed joy? Would the words and ideas flow? Would I be a vessel rather than a forge? A conduit as opposed to a generator? Would the work cease to have a belabored, manipulative quality and become something else? Something better? Something... freer? These questions, and several others which I deleted because they were belabored and manipulative, caused me to look at all the blessings in my life so I could experience a state of joy from which to write. After a little soul-searching I became aware of the grace and bounty which surrounds and sustains me.

Still, she wanted more than anything to be devoured by his earthy passion. Unfortunately the idea of saying ""devour me with your earthy passion"" creeped her out, so instead she murmured ""Hum daddy bow-wow."" He had no idea what she was talking about and found himself wondering whether it was positive verbal feedback in regards to his foreplay technique, or signs of early onset dementia. He went with positive feedback because the notion of making love to a woman who would soon be drooling into a cup was not terribly arousing. Not un-doable, but not a big turn on either. Thus resolved, he threw her to the bed, missing high and to the right. Her head careened off the night stand, somehow turning on the clock radio to an easy listening station.

Lacking inspiration and desperate for a theme, I flipped through my beloved, dog-eared copy of Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke. It was there that I found the following words of wisdom:""Go into yourself. Search for the reason that bids you to write; find out whether it is spreading out its roots in the deepest places of your heart, acknowledge to yourself whether you would have to die if it were denied you to write.Alright, well, it's worth a shot. I'm going into myself... I am searching for the reason that bids me to write... Oop, there it is.

Okay, now that my reasons are clearly located, I'm determining if the roots of those reasons are in the deepest places of my heart... That's a toughie. I've been in TV for too long to still have a heart... I'll just skip ahead to the next question: Would I ""have to die if it were denied me to write?"" Wow, that's pretty heavy...

In order to accommodate these dark, corrosive feelings, I've decided to use my vanity card to begin writing a novel. The book will be a work-in-progress. This means you will often come across passages that will be re-written or simply thrown out.

"Let me explain. I was born Charles Michael Levine and went by the name Chuck Levine until I was twenty-six years old. The reason I changed my name was simple. My mother, never a fan of my father's family, had an unfortunate habit of using Levine as a stinging insult. When displeased with me, she would often say/shriek, ""You know what you are? You're a Levine! A no good, rotten Levine!"" So, for as far back as I can remember, every time I heard my last name I would experience acute feelings of low self-esteem. Whenever roll was called in school I would sit in quiet dread as the teacher ticked off the L's: ""Labianca, Lepkowitz... Levine -- Arghhh!"" My first wife was the one who suggested I change my name to remedy the situation. In fact, it was she who came up with the name Lorre, complete with the fancy spelling. I thought it sounded great. Chuck Lorre. Charles Michael Lorre. Finally a name that did not make me squirm. It didn't occur to me that in England my new name translated into Chuck Truck. Nor did I realize that the famous actor, Peter Lorre, was mostly famous for playing smarmy, closeted gay guys (not that there's anything wrong with it). But most interestingly, I had completely forgotten that when I was around eight years old my father's business began to fail, forcing my mother to find work in a clothing store called... Lorie's. Pretty creepy, huh? Did I abandon my father's name only to unconsciously name myself after a place associated with my mother's abandonment of me?

Well, that and the fact that my grades kind of sucked. But I digress. What I need here is a really profound thought -- something which expresses a unique aspect of my personal philosophy. Okay, how about this: Contrary to conventional wisdom, time is not a dimension. In fact, time does not, in itself, exist. 'Time' is simply the name we give to one aspect of the ever-changing relationship between moving objects in the universe. If nothing moved, there would be no time.

Should his offer be accepted, Lorre plans to create a major motion picture based on the ""Teacup"" ride and the ride with the fake hippos in the water. As far as ABC was concerned, Lorre said creating hits for network TV is a very difficult proposition but he doubted that he could do much worse than that ""Are You Hot"" thing. In exchange for rescuing Disney, his only demand was that he be allowed to run the company part-time. His reasoning being that he loves writing and producing Two and a Half Men. He did indicate that he would come in on the weekends to read scripts and approve price increases at the theme parks.",2004-02-16,"Two and a Half Men"

"Every so often I'm hit with an overwhelming urge to write. An inchoate feeling wells up inside me and demands to substantiate itself through the power of words. When I sat down to write this vanity card, I was in the grip of just such a feeling. Thankfully, it has passed. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp",2004-01-12,"Two and a Half Men"
"The following is an old vanity card that I thought was worth running again. Once upon a time there was a wave. The name of the wave was, no surprise, Dave. Dave the wave. Dave was a big, powerful wave. His massive blue body surged across the surface of the ocean with great majesty and deceptive speed. Oh yes, Dave was quite a wave. From the moment he rose up from the ocean he felt special. He felt invincible. Ferocious storms battered him with wind and rain, great ships sliced through his very heart, and yet he rolled on. It was not for him to stop and consider the other waves. To stop was to die. Waves have to keep moving...or else. But then one day Dave saw a strange darkness on the horizon and, for the first time in his life, felt fear. What could it be? Was it connected to the laughing creature sliding across his face on a piece of wood? But before he could make sense of it all, he crashed down into darkness. For a brief moment he felt a weird, splashing feeling, then oblivion. Dave was no more. He was now a part of the sea. And as we all know, the sea loves to make waves.",2003-12-15,"Two and a Half Men"
"When I was in the shower this morning, I thought: If we assume a Big Bang beginning of the universe, then every molecule, every atom, every proton, every electron, every quark, every wavelength, every vibration, every multi-dimensional string, every everything that makes up everything else shares an ineffable property of pre-Bang Oneness. Assuming that, then every everything is always moving in one of two directions: either away from that primordial state, or returning towards it. We feel these quantum movements. Moving away is experienced as loneliness, fear, anger and despair. Returning is experienced as one or more of the infinite variations and gradations of what we call love. Now, while some might say that equating the miracle of human feelings to the meandering of sub-atomic bric-a-brac robs them of their mystery, the truth is quite the opposite. Connecting our fundamental experience of life to the great mystery of existence ties us to the eternal within our every waking moment. We are not separate. We are made of the same stuff that existed at the beginning and will exist at the end. Therefore, the question we must each ask ourselves is simple: ""In what direction am I moving today - towards oneness, or away from it?"" When I was done reflecting on this, I stepped out of the shower, toweled off, and, while glancing at the mirror, pondered a new thought: ""I have a pretty nice ass for a guy my age.""",2003-11-10,"Two and a Half Men"
"This is the official ""I have nothing worth writing about"" vanity card. It will run whenever I have nothing worth writing about. Don't be surprised to see it quite a bit. From now on, when our schedule requires me to deliver a new card and I'm empty, I'll simply say, ""Run one-eleven."" A check of the one hundred and ten cards I've already written will quickly demonstrate that I should have written this card a long time ago. Why didn't I? Vanity. I had become vain about my vanity cards. I was determined to write a new one each week because, well... I'm just that kind of guy. But I'm older and wiser now. I know when I have nothing to say. And that knowledge is freedom. Freedom from the constant need to win your approval. And more importantly, freedom from the obsessive and relentless need to end each vanity card on a joke.

"THE DREAM: I'm in a cemetery, attending a funeral. I'm not sure whose it is. My mother, who died a year ago, is there -- alive but not well. We leave the funeral and I take her back to a place I used to live that is now unfurnished and cold. There is no food there. I leave her there anyway. I then find myself shopping in a supermarket while holding a baby swaddled in a blanket. The supermarket is run by young people. They play rock music too loudly for a supermarket and seem to be having a good time. I keep losing the baby, putting it down and forgetting where I put it. I select two items and go to the checkout stand where I'm told that one of the items, some sort of raisin bread, is very expensive. I tell the check-out girl I don't want the raisin bread and then realize I've lost the baby again. Thankfully I find the baby but then decide I can't leave my mother in an empty house. I hurry off to bring her back to where I now live, a comfortable home with all the amenities. MY ANALYSIS: The funeral is for my inauthentic self. The self that's been conditioned by parents, culture and environment to survive by whatever means necessary. It is a frightened, angry thing which I'm just now realizing is not my true identity. My mother played a powerful role in its formation. I take her to a barren place because I have not been able to confront nor integrate her influence into my consciousness. The baby is my authentic self. The essential soul that exists before conditioning. I alone am responsible for that self's well-being and am constantly abandoning it in favor of the illusory comfort of the false self. The supermarket is filled with food, music and youthful energy which symbolizes the wisdom, creativity and vitality which nurtures the soul. There is a high price to pay for these things. It is the price of freedom. I balk at paying that price. Finally, I retrieve my mother and bring her back to the nice house, which means I'm ready to bring her influence in my life up to a conscious level. CONCLUSION: My wakeful thinking is not drenched in metaphor, therefore the dream must have originated from some eternal source of compassionate wisdom, or, I shouldn't read books about Jungian psychology before I go to sleep.",2003-10-06,"Two and a Half Men"
"The Two and a Half Men PledgeWe assume an intelligent audience holding remote controls. The only laughter you will hear is the laughter of real people. We will do no ""very special"" episodes. Nobody's having a baby. No one's getting married. Someone is getting divorced. Our characters are flawed, yet smart. The kid is, and will remain, a real kid. There will be no bachelor auctions. No one's getting stranded in a cabin or stuck in an elevator. There will be no dream sequences, talent shows, or fantasies.... at least in the first season. Ditto for homages to ""Rashomon"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and ""A Christmas Carol"". A car horn or other random noise will never be used to cleverly disguise naughty words. We will never have a character enter a scene if it reminds us of Lenny and Squiggy. Pop culture reference jokes are cheap, easy and date the show. We will not do them. There will be no pedantic, socially conscious stories. No matter how poignant the moment, we will never broadcast our studio audience going, ""ahhh"". Similarly, no matter how titillating the moment, we will never broadcast our studio audience going ""wooo!"". If we see 'it' coming we assume you see 'it' coming and we will therefore do our utmost to avoid 'it'. No fat jokes (unless they're really, really funny). The same goes for penis jokes. And finally, unless Chuck gets hit by a bus and Lee takes over, there will be no wacky scenes with little people or night-vision goggles.",NA,"Two and a Half Men"
"When Dharma was cancelled my heart was broken. Over the next few years my efforts to mend it by creating a new show led to an even deeper emotional nadir when I noticed that I had somehow become the author of a seemingly endless succession of failed pilots and pilot scripts. This was not a big enough string of stinkers to lower AOL-Time Warner's stock price (that had already been done by people more incompetent than myself), but my ill-advised attempts at heart-mending were sufficient enough to cause people in suits to not look up from their cobb salads when I ambled into the WB commissary (in Hollywood even has-beens amble). But I was indomitable. I kept writing... and failing... and ambling. And then, about a year ago, my good friend and favorite cross-to-bear, Lee Aronsohn, told me he needed to write something fairly quickly in order to keep his Writer's Guild health insurance. Everyone -- friends, agents, execs -- told me not to get involved. They assured me that I was too big, too successful, for such a partnership. You see where this is going. Lee and I wrote ""Two and a Half Men."" Which brings me to the glaringly obvious spiritual lesson in all this. How do you mend a broken heart? The Bee Gee's never figured it out, but I did. You help a friend keep their health insurance from lapsing.",NA,"Two and a Half Men"

"When I sat down to write this, my five hundredth vanity card, my first inclination was to use self-deprecating humor. Something along the lines of how proud I am to have a large body of work. Sure, it has no real value, but hey, it's still large. If a person were to sit down and try to read all my cards, the verb ""wade"" might come to mind. But then I thought, ""No. I am not going to waste this momentous event with false modesty. I am going to trumpet my accomplishment. I am going to take a well- deserved bow for eighteen years of hard work. Unpaid work. Work done just for the love of doing it. And let's not forget, I've really spilled my guts in some of these things. A man's life and innermost thoughts exposed for all to see. And oh, how I've labored over the jokes. Literally thousands of hours, grinding away, trying to find just the right combination of words to make you laugh. What was I thinking with the self- deprecation? Five hundred vanity cards. Who else has done that? I'll tell you who. Nobody. Just me. Yeah, that's right. You heard me. And I'll tell you another thing. No one ever will do it. You know why? Because you have to produce five hundred friggin' TV shows first!""Okay, I'm done trumpeting.And I think I need help.",2015-05-07,"Mike & Molly"
"I've been around sitcoms for almost thirty years. During that time I've heard a lot of laughter from studio audiences, writers, actors, directors, studio executives, cameramen and myself. But not all laughter is created equal. There are the lonely guffaws of nervous writers and directors anxious to fill the silence that trails behind some jokes like toilet paper on a shoe. And then there's the grimacing, head-bob throat chuckle of network executives. For years I took this strangled, tepid response personally. Now I know it for what it is - the sound of fear. Sometimes studio audiences will try and help a show with what we in the business call ""a mercy laugh."" There's no mistaking this one. It's the sound of two hundred people who just want to go home. And finally, there's the true, out loud, involuntary explosion of laughter. It's a beautiful, contagious sound. For comedy writers, it makes you feel like your life has value. That all your neurotic suffering is worthwhile. Actors have told me it makes them feel like they're surfing a wave of pure happiness... and that they can keep their kids in private school. Network executives tell me they're not sure how they feel until the results from the focus group comes in. Regardless, in a troubled world, real laughter, that spontaneous outburst of humanness, has to be taken as seriously as a wet fart in white pants.",2015-04-30,"Mike & Molly"

"To be read aloud at my funeral.Well... this is depressing. Which, I guess, beats the alternative. Certainly don't want my send off to be a ding-dong-the-witch-is- dead flash mob. Perhaps there's a middle ground. A little light sobbing, some clothes rending. Nothing over the top. To all the actors here, let's try and keep this day about me. Okay, now that we've settled on the appropriate level of somber, I'd like to go over a few things before LIFE GOES ON WITHOUT ME, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! First, I want it known that I am deeply grateful for how things turned out. In retrospect - and yes, everything is in retrospect now - even the awful stuff seems to have had a purpose. When I was a young man a pretty girl smiled at me, so I did exactly what any young man would do, I joined her new-age religion. Seven years later I awoke, as if from a dream, and carried on like nothing happened. Which made sense because for seven years nothing happened. Being too poor to go to a doctor when I had ulcerative colitis made me a big supporter of free health care, as well as appreciative of the life-affirming qualities in a good bowel movement. Two failed marriages and many failed relationships taught me the fine art of apologizing. A decade or so of professional failures proved that hardship builds character, just not a very good one. And then there's all the great things that happened. My children - despite years of fatherly neglect - turned out to be awesome. Shaking off a severe drop in revenue, the Jack Daniels company managed to limp along without me. I stumbled into an incredible career when I realized I had a better chance at becoming the next Sherwood Schwartz than the next Bruce Springsteen. So again, looking back, other than dying, I have no real complaints. Looking forward, well, if the lights in the chapel flicker... NOW!... it means I'm a non-corporeal spiritual entity with a delightful streak of mischievousness (more Spooky than Casper). If not, the likely scenario is I exist only in your memories, and, after the ceremony, as landfill in a Jewish cemetery. So, to sum up a lifetime: ""Here lies me. I did the best I could with what I had. I never stopped trying to be better. My flaws were plentiful. No need to list them here. We all know what they were -- don't we ladies? But I did love. And as I got older I think I learned how to love more. I hope that's what you remember about me.""""And that I was perfectly willing to end a heartfelt moment with a cheap dick joke.""",2015-04-16,"Mike & Molly"
"Hardly  a  day  goes  by  when  I  don't  think  about  quitting  this business.  Hanging it up.  Taking my proverbial bat and ball and going  home.   In  my  imagination,  the  day  after  I  quit  is  a wonderful,  relaxing,  joyful  experience.   I  reconnect  with  old friends, walk on the beach, read, listen to music, play guitar, play  golf,  eat  leisurely  meals  off  of  real  plates,  exercise, meditate, maybe go see a matinee, or take a stab at writing a few pages  of  a  self-indulgent,  joke-free  play  filled  with  people screaming  at  each  other,  and  then,  after  taking  the  dog  for  a walk, climb into bed and fall into a peaceful, stress-free sleep.  The day after that, bored out of my mind, I start drinking around the clock and quickly descend into a dark, frothing madness that leads to either being institutionalized or liver failure and an agonizing,  premature  death.   The  really  scary  part?   There's hardly  a  day  goes  by  when  I  don't  think  about  quitting  this business. ",2011-10-03,"Mike & Molly"
"To my understanding, comedy is a form of entertainment primarily meant to evoke laughter. There are, of course, many other means by which entertainment can be achieved. Off the top of my head, there's suspense, excitement, horror, heartbreak, shock, mild amusement, informative, and physical arousal, aka porn. Sometimes these forms can be combined to create a hybrid type of entertainment. For example, one could conceivably concoct a story that makes the audience laugh, cry, scream, and pause the DVR in order to replay that last bit over and over until they need a Kleenex. My point is, while there are many ways to tell a story, and many purposes to telling them, let's not lose sight of what the categorizing words actually mean. Or, to paraphrase something Sigmund Freud may or may not have said, ""Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, unless it's in your pants pocket, at which point you can safely call it a schlong.""",2015-03-30,"Mike & Molly"

Then I'd roll the special lawnmower over the greens, trying my best to make them both beautiful and challenging. In my mind, I imagined I was grooming Augusta National. Thinking back I can't help but remember that time as being perfect. My heart was at peace, my work was fulfilling, and each day was a gentle echo of the one before. But I quit that job and moved to Los Angeles because I wanted more. Can you imagine that? I wanted more than a par 27 Walden Pond.

"I recently found myself reminiscing about an incident that occurred almost thirty years ago. I had just landed my first job as a prime-time sitcom writer and was sitting in a room 'punching up' a script with a few other young writers and a couple of old pros, when one of the gray-haired, comedy mavens grumbled that the mediocre joke we were trying to improve was ""good enough"" and that we should ""move on."" He rationalized this by saying, ""No one will know the difference"" and, ""It's just a sitcom."" I remember being offended. I quietly promised myself that if I ever got a chance to write and produce my own series I would never think that way. I would never become so jaded and cynical that I squandered the opportunity to entertain people by assuming they ""won't know the difference,"" and by sneeringly regarding what I do for a living as being ""just a sitcom."" And I never have. But I have wondered what exactly is this thing I do. And I think I've finally figured it out. A sitcom is an extended conversation between writers, actors, directors and the audience. In success, the conversation goes on for years. Pre-internet, the viewers responded simply by watching or not watching. Now their opinions are loud, immediate and fully articulated. And it's great. And it's scary. But it's a real conversation between real people with real feelings. So we all need to choose our words carefully.",2015-02-26,"Mike & Molly"

Over and over, I have consciously entrapped myself in difficult situations and relationships and then struggled to get free. Which leads me to wonder, is this cycle the very essence of existence? Are we destined to live out an endless, self- imposed drama entitled ""stuck, free, stuck, free""? Or, with a bit more flourish, ""woe is me, hallelujah, woe is me, hallelujah""? And if this is the case, is life and death just one more variation on the theme? And is it the last? Does the pendulum swinging between entrapment and freedom continue beyond the grave? (Perhaps on a quantum level?) Which poses a new question. If we exist in an eternal loop of suffering and escape, why bother escaping? Why not just embrace the prison we're in? The answer, of course, is that surrender is its own form of freedom. Which is why I've given up on writing my way out of this vanity card.

That means when you choose to give them to us, we, in turn, must return something to you of equal or greater value. And what is that something?

"I've been known to throw my hat in the ring when different high profile jobs become available (I'm easily bored and also the proud owner of a hat). A few weeks ago I dipped a toe into the race for Sheriff of Los Angeles, as well as an open seat in the U.S. Congress. Unfortunately, there was no groundswell of support for either position so I gracefully moved on. But now a real golden opportunity has emerged: President of ABC-Disney TV. Now that's a gig I could kick ass on. Mr. Iger, you and I have known each other a long time. Going back to those halcyon days on ""Roseanne"" when we'd drive to work singing the theme song from the film version of ""MASH."" (Bob knows what I mean. Everyone else can look it up - then look up ""halcyon."") You know I'll give it my all. I already have a great idea for an ABC series. A real ground-breaking dramedy. It's called ""Chastity Jones"" and tells the story of a beautiful woman who, after being burned in relationship after relationship, decides never to have sex again. And I mean never. Which of course makes her wildly attractive to men who pursue her doggedly. And I mean doggedly. Regardless, she stays true to her vow.

"Not that it really matters, but the joke I made at the ProducersGuild Awards regarding Ben Affleck's genitals being of sufficient size to fill the caped crusader's codpiece was just that, a joke. I've never met Mr. Affleck in or out of a men's room. Nor am I in the habit of peeking at another guy's junk while standing at a urinal. (I mostly stare at the tiles and worry that the invisible auto-flush light beam is secretly cooking my internal organs.) I just wanted to open my speech with a cheap laugh about the Golden Globes. To be completely honest, the original version of the joke had me peeing next to and peeking at Martin Scorsese -- who was, at best, a grower not a show-er. I cut it, wisely I thought, because it felt unfair to ""belittle"" a giant of cinema, even if I had issues with ""Hugo."" I then considered telling the same joke with Harvey Weinstein as the celebrity at the neighboring stall, but cut that as well because I worried that he might be able to have me hurt. It was only when I thought of Mr. Affleck that it finally hit me. If I'm going to make up stuff about another man's penis, why not go positive? Embellish his endowment if you will. It's still funny. And it also allowed me to work in the Comic-Con Batman angle. Win-win right? Wrong. While the joke did score at the PGA event, it got way too much traction afterward. Which is why I now feel the need to set the record straight. You want to know if Affleck is man enough to be Bruce Wayne? Ask his wife. Or, if you're feeling man enough, rent ""Daredevil.""

"I had a recurring dream as a child that left an indelible mark on me. Unlike my other dreams, this one had no recognizable images, no mommies or daddies, no friends, relatives, teachers, scary monsters or scrappy Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek.  This dream was simply a field of darkness and light fighting to dominate my mental screen. That was it.  For what seemed like long periods of time, I would bear silent witness to a cosmic struggle between malicious, inky blackness and radiant, life-affirming light.  I would, of course, be pulling for the light to win.  But it never did.  No matter how much I willed it, light could never maintain the field of view.  Darkness would always come crawling back, invading the space and ultimately taking over.  It was both exhausting and upsetting.  Thankfully, at some point during early adolescence, the dream stopped, never to return.  Looking back, I see it as no more than an immature mind's attempt to reconcile good and evil.  I understand now that the world is not nearly that simple.  Those two opposing forces do not actually exist. They are evaluations. Opinions.  And yet, my mind continually tries to manifest them as being real.  I catch myself doing it whenever I toggle back and forth between MSNBC and Fox News playing out their cable TV version of my childhood dream.  The only difference is that I'm an adult now.

While there is no guarantee that the transgressor will be relieved of shame and guilt, the forgiver will always feel better. In other words, forgiveness is, first and foremost, self-serving. Now I am all about self-serving, so for the last few years I have been practicing a sort of forgiveness mantra.

"I'm a big believer in the old maxim, ""If you don't ask, you don't get."" With that in mind, I'd like to throw caution to the wind and ask the Vatican's College of Cardinals to consider me for the job opening that recently became available. Now, before you say anything, let me be the first to point out the many reasons ""why not."" I'm Jewish. I've never understood the hoopla over the Old Testament, with all the smiting and begetting. I'm a twice- divorced sitcom writer with a shady past. And perhaps most importantly, I look silly in a hat. No argument, the cons are plentiful. But let's take a moment to examine the pros. First, I am completely untouched by the abuse scandal that is currently engulfing the church. I can stand on the balcony that overlooks St. Peter's Square and say to the adoring masses, with a straight, albeit Semitic face, ""Folks, I've never even met an altar boy."" With me as your pontiff you buy yourself some serious deniability. Next, believe it or not, I happen to be a very spiritually inclined guy. I would love a job where my primary thrust was encouraging prayer, meditation and acts of loving kindness. (Although in the interest of full disclosure, we would have to negotiate some common sense middle ground for any other thrusting I might want to do. It'd be a shame to waste adoring masses as long as they consist entirely of consenting adults.) And finally, there's the issue of my name. How can a billion true believers not smile and breathe a sigh of relief when the white smoke coming from the chimney is to announce the investiture of Pope Chuck? Cardinals, I want to assure you that while my papacy is a little ""outside the box,"" you can rest assured that I would passionately carry the good word to all the poor and the downtrodden, beginning with a holy visit to Saint-Tropez, or maybe the Bahamas or Turks & Caicos. And just think of the marketing opportunities! How is ""Pope Chuck"" not the name of the next Adam Sandler movie? What's to stop me from busting a move on the balcony and starting a dance craze called ""Pope Chuckin'""? And don't get me started on the demographic potential of a TV show entitled ""Pope Chuck, P.I."" (Kiss the ring, or get punched by it!)

"According to futurist, inventor and all-around incredibly smart guy, Ray Kurzweil, human beings actually reorganize their frontal cortex as they pursue mastery over different skills. For example, a musician redesigns his or her brain by means of constant study, practice and performance. The same thing applies to a mathematician, carpenter and pole dancer. The brain is physically changed over time by activity and learning. This means we have direct influence and control over how our minds operate. This means we actually mold our perception of the world by the way we mold our brains. This means that over the last twenty-five years, I have reshaped my frontal lobe to do one thing, and one thing only -- write sitcoms. I can't tell you what a relief this knowledge is to me. To begin with, it single-handedly explains why I fail so consistently at other activities (golf, common courtesy and marriage come to mind). It also eases my fears about my disintegrating memory. Why would my brain waste precious neurons remembering where I put my glasses (on the top of my head), or the names of the camera crew (I think one guy is named John, or maybe Jamie or Nigel), when it's working overtime trying to structure a joke about a character masturbating like a meth-addled spider monkey?

"I need to apologize. In an earlier vanity card I made a derisive comment about a popular reality show because I thought its premise - a group of single women compete with one another to win the affections of, and ultimately marry, an eligible man - was more threatening to the sanctity of marriage than gay people tying the knot. After careful consideration, I now realize that I couldn't have been more wrong. My mistake was that I was looking at the show through the tired old eyes of 60's feminism. But we are clearly in a post-feminist era. The patriarchal sexism that treated women as chattel and dictated how much they could earn or how much control they could have over their own bodies is a thing of the past, a curious relic of a dark, unenlightened time. Likewise, the idea that a woman without a man was somehow incomplete has long ago been consigned to the overflowing dustbin of humankind's misbegotten thinking. Women are now free to do anything they want, and that includes going on a reality show and using all their female wiles to snag Mr. Right.I really don't know what else to say except, ""I'm sorry and, um... you go, girl!""",2012-11-08,"Mike & Molly"

"I'm reluctant to use my vanity cards to plug the sale of my vanity card book. That doesn't mean I won't do it, I'm just reluctant. Or perhaps the better word is ambivalent - of two minds.

"From what little I know of prehistory, man roamed the Earth for hundreds of thousands of years in small tribes -- probably no more than two hundred people per group.  During this time all wisdom was passed along according to the oral tradition.  Everything you needed to know in order to succeed as a human being was told and/or shown to you, whether it be how to find a girl, find a guy, have sex, have a baby, find food, raise children, deal with family, argue with neighbors, care for the sick, elderly and dead, fight, work, sing, dance, play and get really loaded in order to hookup with the universe.  (Side note: I've always loved the term ""prehistory,"" which arrogantly implies that prior to the emergence of our culture, nothing happened.)  Anyway, this state of affairs lasted for a long, long time.  It was relatively stable.  Peace on Earth, if you will.  Then, with the advent of large-scale agriculture and the need for ever larger swathes of land to accommodate it, the tribal system collapsed and people began to live huddled together in towns, villages and cities.  In short order, the priceless wisdom that taught us who we were and how we could live a happy life was forever lost to mankind.  Which brings us to today.  I don't believe that we became a neurotic and self-destructive species because we're born in sin, or otherwise flawed.  I believe our fall from grace was simply a forgetting.

"When I was in grade school we would regularly have atomic bomb drills. One of my favorites was clambering under our little wooden desks, quick like bunnies, so that we would be ""protected"" when the shock wave hit our big picture window and sent thousands of shards of glass shrapnel into our classroom. Equally helpful was the instruction to unbutton the top button of our shirts, remove glasses and take sharp items like pencils from our breast pockets. The logic being that collars could strangle us during a nuclear blast, glasses became just more shrapnel, and number two pencils could shish kabob our eight-year old hearts. Often we were ordered to line up, double file, hold our partner's hand (hopefully a girl, hopefully without a sweaty palm) and walk, don't run, down to the school's basement. There we would crouch next to a cold cement wall, thus ensuring our survival, or burial, in case the entire place got flattened. Interestingly, I don't recall there being any real concern about radiation poisoning other than how it might create Tokyo-stomping monsters. But probably my most vivid memory is of something that never happened. I had a recurring daydream which involved me neatly surviving the end of the world, climbing out of the rubble that was once Oak Drive Elementary School, and then running home to save the lives of my parents. Sadly, in none of my heroic fantasies was I able to rescue my older sister (we didn't get along that well, so it was probably for the best). The reason I bring all this up is I was thinking recently about how an almost daily reminder to a child that he or she might die in a terrifying explosion could cause a kind of post-traumatic syndrome. In a way, it made me feel a bit more forgiving to the monumental failings of the boomer generation. I also thought I should try and mend fences with my sister.",NA,"Mike & Molly"

For  example,  I  recently  became fascinated with the rather routine word 'miscellaneous.'  To begin with, it really sounds great.  Miscellaneous.  I dare you to say it out loud and not smile.  Plus, you can just forget its meaning and have fun with it. ""Miscellaneous, miss a lot.""  Then consider its long journey from the Latin 'miscere' (to mix), to its current form. How did miscere become miscellaneous?  Whose idea was it to drop  the  'ere'  and  add  the  'ellaneous?'   And why?   Were they drunk?  Was it some sort of strange speech impediment that caught on with the general populace?  Or more likely, did the French get hold of it and decide to do what they do best - unnecessarily fancy it up?  Makes you think, right?  And speaking of the paths words take to arrive at their current form, how can anyone not be entranced  by  the  rocky  road  traveled  by  the  old  Germanic  word ' f i c k e n ' (to  move  back  and  forth)?

"I'm going to let you in on a powerful secret.  A secret so big, once you know it, your life will never be the same.  Okay, here it is: Buy the problem, buy the solution.   Got it?   No?   Alright, fine,  lemme  break  it  down  for  you.   If  someone  can  devise  a problem  and  convince  you  that  it  is  the  cause  of  all  your troubles,  then  they  can  sell  you  a  solution.   And  here's  the kicker: If you really believe in the problem, the solution will actually work.  For example: If you can be conned into thinking that the reason you're unhappy is because your body is encrusted with evil spirits (the problem), there is an organization that will, for a very reasonable price (considering your dilemma), free you  of  the  pernicious  little  devils  and  make  you  feel  like  a demigod  (the  solution).   The  same  holds  true  with  the  thorny thicket proposed by another, more established  institution: If you can be made to believe that your life is in ruins because you were ""born in sin"" (the problem), then salvation is just a donation away (the solution).  On a secular level, if you can be convinced that the reason you're miserable is because a black guy wants you to get health insurance (the problem), then relief is available through a small campaign contribution (the solution).  Got it now?  Buy  the  problem,  buy  the  solution.   Here's  one   created  by  a pharmaceutical company: She's ready, but he's not (the problem), which forces him to buy a pill to ensure that he's always ready (the solution).  This one amuses me because the company assumes it's his problem.  But it could just as easily be hers.  Why not sell her a pill?  Maybe something to make her less ready.",2012-04-16,"Mike & Molly"

"I believe that we have a cultural obsession with things getting better. Corporate profits MUST rise. Gross domestic product (whatever the hell that is) MUST go up.Teenage pregnancies, smoking related deaths, the deficit and unemployment numbers MUST go down. Well, clearly no one else wants to ask the question, so I will. Why? Why MUST life constantly improve? When did we become so burdened with this need for things to always get better? I'm pretty sure that if we go back in time far enough we'll find that our ancestors didn't stress over it. Life was good, then it was bad, then it was the same, then it got good again, etc. For millions of years, things rarely got great and often got horrible.

Furthermore, I pinpoint its origin with Darwin's Theory of Evolution, which I believe mistakenly implies that it's in the nature of nature to ""get better."" We all know the deal, amino acids improve to amoebas, which improve to jelly fish, blah, blah, blah, homo sapiens (assuming evolution ends with us, which it doesn't).

"I just watched a PBS special about the nature of space hosted by noted author, physicist and Big Bang Theory alumnus, Brian Greene.   When it was over, I was struck by the thought that the mysterious dark energy that fills the universe might be what human beings have been praying to for thousands of years.  I mean, think about it.   What  if  prayer  and  meditation  are  natural,  evolutionary pathways to connect to Einstein's cosmological constant, Buddha's nirvana  and  Jesus's  dad?   According  to  physicists,  this  dark energy  is  both  infinite  in  extent  and  the  prime  mover  for  an expanding universe.  Kinda fits the bill, right?  Let's take it a step further.  What if gravity, the mysterious force pulling the cosmos inward, is what our feeble frontal lobes perceive as evil?  And finally, what if the two forces in balance are what allow for the whole shebang to exist in the first place?  We label them good and bad.  Love and hate.  Life and death.  But at the end of the day, all we have are two fundamental quantum thingies that can be directly  experienced.   Hmm...  not  sure  what  to  do  with  this revelation.   It's  kind  of  a  coin  flip  between  starting  a  new religion  -  you  know,  going  full  frontal  L.  Ron  Hubbard  -  and applying for a federal tax exemption - or just making a nice donor pledge to PBS.  ",2011-11-21,"Mike & Molly"
"Among the team of superheroes, his power was the least envied.  As The Human Sponge, he had the ability to absorb the emotions of people nearby and make them his own - to the point of actually forgetting that what he was feeling did not originate with him.  While his fellow crime fighters fought evil by hurling bolts of lightning or with amazing displays of strength, The Human Sponge could  only  sit  next  to  the  villain  o'  the  day  and  soak  up  his festering rage.   Needless to say, when the weary band of capedcrusaders returned to their secret lair, Sponge was not very good company.

"An odd thing happens after you've seen your name in print over and over again.   It becomes detached from your sense of self.   The shipping label no longer has any relationship with what's in the box.  The experience is sort of like when you were a kid and you'd quickly repeat a word until it had no meaning and was just a funny sound.   It's  disorienting  when  that  happens  to  your  name,  but after  awhile,  surprisingly,  it's  actually  quite  liberating. There's your name in an article or some blog, and then, far away, in some other place - or no place if you're feeling zennish - is you.   Another way to look at it is to imagine a soul or spirit rising up from a corpse.  Everybody is standing around the dearly departed,  singing  his  praises  or  bitching  about  him,  while  his 'ectoplasmic body' is hovering near the ceiling and yelling, ""Hey, I'm  over  here!   I'm  not  that.   I'm  something  else.""   (Or, zennishly, nothing else.)  Of course, aside from the family dog, no one can hear or see him.  They're all fixated on the body.  The name.   Which brings up an interesting idea. Dogs don't know our names. They see the real us, sans moniker.  If they think anything when we walk into a room, it's probably something like, ""Hey, it's food, petting and playing!""",2011-11-07,"Mike & Molly"

"We  are  a  story-telling  folk.   For  millennia,  we  have  used  the narrative  device  to  educate,  enlighten,  entertain,  frighten, enthrall and just plain tickle each other. That's how we roll.  The  problem  with  story-telling  comes  with  the  stories  we  tell ourselves and, more importantly, the degree to which they depart from  what's  actually  happening.   That's  how  we  unravel.   For instance, a heart-wrenching yarn that details a life filled with tragedy and impending doom, when in reality everything is fine, can be found within the mind of your average teenage girl... or middle-aged comedy writer.   On the other end of the spectrum is the man who regales himself with a fantasy adventure about being a demigod  who  is  beloved  by  all,  when,  in  fact,  he's  dying, everything  is  going  to  hell  and  his  friends  and  family  have changed their home phone numbers and begun lighting prayer candles  (no need to discuss examples for that story).

"Once upon a time there was a sea turtle and a wolf who became friends. Now you might think that these are two animals who wouldn't have much to do with each other. And you'd be right. One was a plodding, oddly-shaped ocean dweller, while the other was a sleek predator who prowled the forests for unwary deer. Their friendship began when the wolf was out hunting and saw the turtle sunning himself on the beach. The turtle looked rather unappetizing, so there was never any real thought of eating him. Nonetheless, the wolf was curious about this curious creature. And vice versa. The two got to talking and the turtle told the wolf about an island not too far offshore that was filled with delicious animals just waiting to be eaten. Needless to say, the story got the wolf's attention. A deal was quickly struck in which the turtle would ferry the wolf to the island every day in exchange for a portion of whatever the wolf killed. This arrangement worked out quite well. Many years went by and both animals got fat and happy. But there came a time when the wolf decided he didn't need the turtle anymore and could swim to the island on his own. After all, he'd been watching the turtle make the daily journey for a long time and it certainly didn't look very hard. But it was. Not long after the wolf jumped into the ocean, he was quickly overcome by the relentless waves and fierce undertow. He struggled and howled, but to no avail. The proud wolf sank to the floor of the sea where his body was quickly engulfed by a swarm of bottom-feeding crabs. His last thought was, ""I wonder if it's too late to work with the turtle?"" The moral of the story? Stick with the program or be stuck with bottom-feeding crabs.",2011-05-16,"Mike & Molly"

"I understand that I'm under a lot of pressure to respond to certain statements made about me recently. The following are my uncensored thoughts. I hope this will put an end to any further speculation.    I believe that consciousness creates the illusion of individuation, the false feeling of being separate. In other words, I am aware, ergo I am alone. I further believe that this existential misunderstanding is the prime motivating force for the neurotic compulsion to blot out consciousness. This explains the paradox of our culture, which celebrates the ego while simultaneously promoting its evisceration with drugs and alcohol. It also clarifies our deep-seated fear of monolithic, one-minded systems like communism, religious fundamentalism, zombies and invaders from Mars. Each one is a dark echo of an oceanic state of unifying transcendence from which consciousness must, by nature, flee. The Fall from Grace is, in fact, a Sprint from Grace.

"Schadenfreude     The New York Times recently reported that The Parents Television Council was in trouble. Just to catch you up, the PTC is a non- profit watchdog group charged with sanitizing American television.  I'm more than a little proud of the fact that they've spent years trying to blunt the success of Two and a Half Men (as if we weren't capable of doing our own blunting). Currently, their number one priority is organizing advertiser boycotts of a profanely titled CBS series starring William Shatner.

"The following are a few questions I've been wrestling with:Who decided that trendy mens' footwear should look like bowling shoes?When did charming start passing for funny?Aren't we as a nation sophisticated enough to hunt down and kill our enemies without constantly referring to them as ""evil""?Shouldn't people who drive those monster sports utility vehicles be required to take a truck-driving test?And while we're on the subject, what does it say about us as a civilized and compassionate society when we allow our children to drive at the age of sixteen?What does it say about us as a civilized and compassionate society when Jay consistently beats Dave?Are we almost done with entertainment based on humiliation, teenage girls singers, prefab boy bands and rap, or is this an eternal punishment?Shouldn't fashion models look a little like us?And finally, why can't I shake the feeling that the infinite emptiness that gnaws at my soul and refuses to be filled by any external means is the secret engine that drives our entire culture?I eagerly await your answers.",2002-04-16,"Dharma & Greg"

"In an early draft of the very first episode of Dharma & Greg, Dharma's last name was Lowenstein; Greg had an angry and neurotic sister named Penny; Greg's father was romantically involved with a beautiful Swedish au pair named Gjerta; Greg's mother was a lush; Dharma's best friend was named Veronica; Dharma and Greg never go to a baseball game or Reno for pie but they do go to a local coffee shop where they deal with a sarcastic waitress named Connie who has every laugh in the scene; Dharma nobly offers Greg an annulment; Dharma's dad tries to convince some policemen that the pot on his property is not his (and if it was it would be legal since he has glaucoma); and finally, Greg arrives to refuse the annulment and save Mr. Lowenstein. I bring this up as a way of reminding myself that I get deeply attached to things I write (in this case co-write) and become fiercely resistant to change, even though I know from experience that every thing I've ever done got better with each successive draft. Taken a step further, perhaps this obsessive drive to protect an early draft is a microcosmic view of the struggle to resist evolution on a macro scale. Perhaps the struggle to resist is an essential part of the process. Perhaps the human race is merely an early draft, a minor blip in an inexorable and endless process of cosmic re-writes. But I digress. Gjerta? Whoa, what were we thinking?",2002-04-02,"Dharma & Greg"
"The following are my opening remarks in a speech I made at a fund-raising dinner for a free clinic in Los Angeles. As I began speaking I could hear the audience gasp at the darkness of my story (a true story by the way). Thankfully, when I arrived at the end, the somber mood was broken. I hope it has the same effect as a vanity card. ""In 1976, when I was very ill with ulcerative colitis, weighed 120 pounds and was without any health insurance, I went to the old Cedars of Lebanon hospital and was given free medical attention by allowing myself to be what was essentially a lab rat for their teaching program. What I didn't know at the time, was that the incredible pain and humiliation of receiving a colonoscopy in front of a classroom of medical students was perfect preparation for writing and producing 'Roseanne', 'Grace Under Fire' & 'Cybill'.

"It's funny how writing takes you down roads you never imagined travelling. When I began this vanity card I had what I thought were several sophisticated themes worth delving into. One dealt with the quantum physics discovery that the very act of observing a phenomenon changes the phenomenon. Another explored how I might behave if all my problems were suddenly and mysteriously solved (my contention was that I would obsessively create more problems almost immediately). And still a third premise discussed the always popular ideas of self-love and self-forgiveness. My premise here was that these sorts of concepts are inherently flawed and potentially destructive in that they deal with the individual as something that is split in half: the forgiver and the forgiven, the lover and the beloved. But in the end I managed to abandon all my heady themes the minute I realized the deep personal significance of this card number. I was thirteen years old when ""Get Smart"" debuted in 1965. I thought it was hilarious and had an immediate and massive crush on Agent 99. To further complicate matters, I was tormented by the knowledge that 99 had a crush on 86 (Maxwell Smart). Thankfully, 86 was moronically oblivious to her affections, so I retained a childish hope that one day she would be mine. Needless to say, my love remained unrequited. But it was not in vain. Thirty-seven years later that innocent boyhood crush would bear fruit as vanity card #99.",2002-03-19,"Dharma & Greg"

The ones I find most touching are Reese Witherspoon, best actress for Legally Blonde, and Drew Barrymore, best actress for Riding in Cars with Boys. In Drew's ad, Gene Shallit of the Today Show calls her ""a meritorious actress,"" while in Reese's ad, Susan Wloszczyna of the NY Observer says she ""serves justice in delicious fashion."" That, my friends, is high praise indeed. Personally, I hope they're both nominated, and then tie for the win.

"Procrastination is the thief of time. I had a fifth grade teacher named Mr. Penzel who taught me that saying. I never forgot it. I also never put it to good use because here it is Sunday night and this vanity card is due tomorrow. Mr. P also taught me that ""fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me"" thing. Of course that saying neglected to mention that throughout my life the one person most likely to fool me would be me, so it too proved to be somewhat limited in its effectiveness. In addition to clever little axioms, Mr. Penzel tried to teach me to think for myself, to have the courage to be unique, to rebel against the status quo. During the height of Beatlemania (and it was most definitely a mania) he mischievously tried to get our class to embrace a ""we hate the Beatles"" attitude. He failed. But let me tell you, asking a bunch of thirteen-year-olds in 1964 to even consider not being part of a youth phenomenon like the Beatles was as iconoclastic as you could get. It's funny, I don't remember what I ate for breakfast yesterday, but I vividly remember Mr. Penzel, short, dark-haired, almost impish, putting up a new ""wise saying"" every Monday on the small bulletin board near the door, directly below the clock.

"If you saw our Thanksgiving episode you might have noticed that we had a bit of fun at the expense of Fort Wayne, Indiana. It is my sincere hope that this vanity card will help to unruffle any Hoosier feathers by stating that the only city worthy of comic derision is a city of substance -- a city that was ranked in the nation's top ten to ""Earn and Save Money"" in the year 2000. A city that was ranked 21st in the top 50 U.S. Best Small Metro Areas for Growing and Starting a Business by Inc. Magazine. A city that, like a rose, smells as sweet when it's called The City of Restaurants, the Gateway to the West, Summit City, City of Churches, The Happiest City, The City That Saved Itself and the All American City. A city that is the birth place of the man without whom there'd be no Honeymooners, no Roots, no I Love Lucy, and no Chuck Lorre Vanity Cards, the inventor of television, Philo T. Farnsworth! And finally, a city that is home to a number of Exec. Producer Bill Prady's relatives. Which, to be perfectly honest, is the main reason we picked Fort Wayne and picked on it. So Bill can go to family re-unions, tell everyone that the episode where Dharma and Greg go on a romantic holiday and get stranded in Fort Wayne was his idea and then ""humbly"" accept their good-natured, finger-wagging acclaim.

"When someone loves you, do you really feel their love? To feel their love you'd have to assume that there are 'love particles' (or waves) that radiate from person to person. If you believe that then you'd have to believe that movie stars are constantly bombarded by a warm, fuzzy feeling as a result of the worldwide emanations of love flowing toward them. Trust me, they feel bombarded, but not by the warm and the fuzzy. Or try this: When you look at your beloved and feel that special feeling, does your beloved look up from their oatmeal and realize they're the lucky recipient of your love? It is my contention that if they did look up, the only thing they'd realize is that there's a big gob of oatmeal on their pajamas. I would also contend that their only inkling that you love them is when you smile and say, ""Honey, would you like me to make you some oatmeal?"" And that wouldn't actually be feeling love as much as inferring love (she cooked me oatmeal, she smiled at me, my mother cooked me oatmeal, my mother smiled at me, my mother said she loved me, ergo she loves me). My guess is that when you're feeling loved, what you're actually feeling is the love you have for the other person. That's good news, right? If all we ever wanted was to be loved, the key to that love was in our hands the entire time. To feel love, give love. Simple. Or, if you prefer, spend all your time becoming famous so you can be bombarded with 'love particles' while you're checking into a rehab facility in the desert.",2001-12-04,"Dharma & Greg"
"Forgive me if I've been through this before, but I feel it needs repeating: my mind is not my friend. Its ability to look into the environment, perceive ""what is"" and relate it back to me here at Chuck Central, is depressingly inadequate. As a result, I find myself listening to this sort of interior dialogue: ""Hmm, the people I work for want to have a meeting with me on Monday regarding my new script. They probably want to tell me they don't like it. They'll tell me that because they're power-hungry and if they like it they have no power. Power is derived from not liking it and forcing changes. Maybe I should just call them now, tell them I'm sick and tired of the endless politics, and quit. Yeah, that's what I'll do. I'll quit and write movies... that will never be produced. I'll wind up one of those bitter, old guys who sits around the union hall, playing pinochle and complaining about how lousy TV comedy is and how much better it was in my day. So, no, I won't quit, but I won't take any of their stupid notes either. Besides, I don't know how to play pinochle. Here's what I'll do -- I'll be a prima donna. I'll be insanely difficult. Or, better yet, I'll simply roll over and do whatever is asked of me. Covert apathy, that's the ticket! They can't get to you if you don't care! By Monday morning, after a weekend of this sort of cerebral noise, I was ready to lash out at the slightest provocation. ""Chuck, would you like some coffee?"" ""Screw you! I quit!!!""

"HOT, FILTHY SEX! Okay, the truth is I have nothing to back up that first sentence in the way of content. I just thought that since this is a sweeps episode, and traditionally sweeps episodes are supposed to be extremely provocative and highly promotable in order to achieve higher than usual ratings, I'd do my part by writing a vanity card that really grabs your attention (I've also noticed that when the card is broadcast you can only read the first three or four words, so this should raise a few eyebrows). Another tried-and-true element of sweeps episodes is what's called stunt casting. This means that inordinate amounts of money are spent to cast big stars as special guests on the show. Once again, the hoped for result is to pump up the ratings during the specified sweeps period.

"I wrote what I thought was a particularly clever essay for my ninetieth vanity card. Unfortunately, you can't read it because it did not make it past the censor. Apparently it was considered to be disrespectful towards certain unnamed people I dubbed ""corporate overlords."" Upon re-reading it I can understand how one might view it that way. I guess I was hoping that those in power would simply laugh at my juvenile irreverence and that would be the end of it. ""Oh, that Chuck! What a wild and iconoclastic sense of humor he has!"" (In my in imagination when they speak about me all their sentences end with exclamations because just the thought of me excites them.) Anyway, the premise of my now dead essay was that I wielded immense leverage as a result of a large, devoted, cult-like group of vanity card readers who could, when sent into action by me, positively influence the ratings of D & G. This personal leverage could then be used to force the unnamed power brokers to negotiate with me ""on my terms."" The big funny of the essay was that I had no idea what ""my terms"" might be. I visualized a scenario wherein I sat in a boardroom eating deli sandwiches with important people who ""trembled"" at my ability to command vast legions of TV viewers through my vanity cards. Hopefully when my time here on Earth has drawn to an end, the original draft of number ninety will be discovered and cherished by generations as yet unborn. But until that day, this card will have to do. Number ninety with an asterisk. Unless of course this card gets axed because it too fails to meet broadcast standards.

"I don't know about you, but my fundamental character flaws are so deeply embedded in my consciousness, it actually feels as if they're entwined with the strands of my DNA. Lately I like to imagine that as a child I was a sort of brand new, meat-based computer that had an operating system installed with big, whopping design problems. The result is that when my scanning mechanisms bring in data from my environment, I invariably process that data in ways that do not reflect reality. Example: I walk into a room that contains people. They are speaking amongst themselves and laughing. My immediate computational response is summed up by a voice in my head which says, ""They're laughing at me. Why are they laughing at me? I hate them."" Or: I see, hear or read about someone who has achieved great success in my field. My organic computer processes this info and spits out, ""Danger! Danger! Survival is threatened!"" Are these fundamental character flaws? You betcha! Taken to an extreme this sort of thinking can cause a lot of suffering -- and not just to me. In my rare moments of mental and emotional clarity I've come to realize that this is an unavoidable part of who I am. The trick now is to overcome or at least soften my flaws before I'm sent back to the factory as damaged goods. Example: When I wrongly think I'm the center of the universe and my problems take precedence over the problems of others, I pause and say to myself, ""Error. You are useless, ugly and unworthy of being loved."" At which point I say, ""Why should I listen to you? A broken computer can't repair a broken computer.""

"Perhaps it's part of our basic nature to drift into a waking dream state when there are no serious threats on the horizon. Perhaps that's why the universe is constructed as a dangerous universe -- to keep us awake. Maybe God felt it was redundant for the creatures inside his/her/its dream to be dreaming as well. If that's the case, the plan is working, my dream is over. In this dream, I lived in an invulnerable fortress, safe from the misery, ignorance, jealousy, hatred and chaos that surrounded it. I dreamt that the minutiae of my life was important. I dreamt that I could make my little plans. I dreamt that everyone was essentially playing by the same rules. And finally, I dreamt that my dream was reality. Which is why I feel a strange tinge of gratitude bubbling under my grief, fear and rage. I'm grateful to be even a little awake.

"Depression. Sadness. Grief. The blues. Self-pity. Melancholy. Regret. Remorse. Low. Broken-hearted. Down-trodden. Morose. These are but a few of the words that come to mind when trying to describe my mood as of late. Now before you call a suicide prevention number on my behalf, please know that I am aware that the condition these words describe will pass. The problem as I see it is not the condition but the feeling implied by my gloomy list of words (I can't believe I forgot to put 'gloomy' on the list). The feeling is so bad that my tendency in the past has been to feel anger whenever sadness threatened, for the simple reason that sadness feels worse than anger. Anger at least can flow outwards. Sadness flows in. On the other hand, anger generates road rage and getting your head caved in by a guy in a pickup truck with a tire iron, while sadness inspires you to watch unbelievably bad TV to distract you from feeling sadness. And, of course, both sadness and anger stem from fear -- fear of losing what you have or fear of not getting what you want. And fear stems from the tightly-held belief that what you have and/or want is even remotely important. To be fearless is to be free from desire -- even desire for one's own life.

"This is my fourth attempt at writing this vanity card. My first attempt was a not-very-witty ""welcome back"" sort of thing. You know the type. I've done them at the start of earlier D&G seasons and thought it might again bear fruit. Needless to say, fruit was not borne. I then tried my hand at a cute little essay on workaholism and its psychic roots in my painfully juvenile demand for admiration. I think we can all agree that no more need be said about that (actually quite a bit can be said about it, but nothing I want to share with strangers who might taunt me in public). Then, seeing as how I'm currently sitting in a plane flying across the country, I took a feeble pass at how I feel simultaneously powerless and awestruck when strapped into a slender metal tube that is soaring through the sky. During this last piece I never actually wrote the word ""sophomoric,"" but a thin, nasal voice in my head kept repeating it over and over. And finally, I tried to make sense of my new position on D&G as a consultant, while at the same time wrestling with the cultural implications and definition of the word ""has-been."" (For the record, I defined a has-been as a someone who did something which resulted in their becoming a somebody, but then stopped doing it, causing them to revert to being a someone, which is not nearly as good as a somebody.) It should come as no surprise that I was soundly defeated in this semantic battle as well. Which leaves me with no vanity card this week. I just hope you know I tried. I really, really tried.",NA,"Dharma & Greg"
"In certain cultures people greet each other with a little bow and their hands pressed together in a prayer position. This is meant to convey that one acknowledges the divinity in the other. In our culture we greet each other by shaking hands, a gesture meant to convey the cheery thought, ""See? I'm not holding a weapon."" Personally, I like the divinity ""hi, how are ya"" a lot better. In fact, sometimes I like to walk down the street and remind myself that each and every person I see is of divine origin and on a journey that is unique, profound, tragic, joyous and, to them, immensely important (airports are also good for this exercise). Now that's not to say that I don't often consider others as being mere speed bumps on my little drive through life.

What remains indisputable, however, is that the deed is done. Eighty vanity cards can be read, relished, or rejected. I now have something in common with the legendary author, Jules Verne. He wrote a story entitled, Around The World In Eighty Days. I wrote eighty vanity cards.

The only thing I have even the vaguest control over is my attitude which preceded the precipitating, bad mood-causing event. That attitude could best be described as a fiercely held conviction that people are supposed to behave in a Chuck-approved manner. When they don't, Chuck immediately becomes the organic repository for the aforementioned bad mood. Now one might deduce that my only escape from these foul states of mind is to discard my fiercely held conviction. But to do that, I'd have to lovingly accept a world that infrequently lives up to my expectations. In other words, I'd have to be somewhat God-like (assuming an all-forgiving God). Which means that in vanity card #78 I'll have to start working on a plan 'B'.",2001-04-03,"Dharma & Greg"
"As I write this there exists a substantial threat of strikes in the film and TV business -- first from the writers guild, then from the actors guild. Well, I'd like to make a prediction. I predict that after all the yelling and finger-pointing is over, when the smoke finally clears, the single issue that will actually be the cause of these strikes will be... the internet. The folks who run the conglomerates that own the companies that produce the various entertainment products have seen the future. And that future, despite the NASDAQ's current problems, is the internet -- what's on it, who owns what's on it, and, most importantly, who profits from what's on it. As the future of this incredible, planetary network is being fought over, I can't help but think back to the first time I logged on in 1989. For a nominal sum, I signed up for Compuserve. If I recall correctly, I had 2400 baud. There was a dial tone, a horrible noise, then, miracle of miracles, a world of goofy teenagers chatting with each other via badly written sentences. I sat there and marvelled that my little computer was suddenly linked to other little computers in faraway places. I marvelled, then I logged off. It was incredibly slow and boring. Well, it's not slow and boring anymore. And it may put a lot of people out of work for a very long time. Which, IMHO, isn't a LOL situation. :>)",2001-03-13,"Dharma & Greg"
"As I write this I'm being interviewed by Jeannie McDowell, a reporter for Time magazine. Jeannie's writing an article about comedy on television. She agreed to let me take notes of the interview for my vanity card, but I'm not sure she really knew what a vanity card was. Throughout the Q & A, I try to maintain a mildly-amusing, self-deprecating manner. When asked why TV comedies are struggling these days, I cleverly quip that maybe the problem lies in poor diet or lack of exercise -- but I don't think she writes that down. When she asks about the proliferation of ""dramadies,"" my response is immediate, sharp and insightful. But, neurotically afraid to offend, I hedge my bet by adding that maybe audiences prefer a show that succeeds at being amusing, rather than fails at being funny. I also mention that the media doesn't write treatises about movie comedies sucking because they're not shoved down our throats every week like bad TV shows are. Unfortunately, I can tell that's not a good sound bite -- even for print, which requires, I guess, ""print bites."" I sense that the interview isn't going well so my mind begins to wander. I imagine a sitcom about a reporter for Time magazine who's interviewing a writer. He's a smart, sexy writer...",2001-03-27,"Dharma & Greg"
"To whom it may concern, We have taken Chuck Lorre hostage. Do not try to find him. Do not alert the authorities. Until our demands are met he will be held in a really nice house in Los Angeles where he'll be forced to eat rich foods and watch satellite TV with all the premium channels and pay-per-view. The following are a list of our demands: We must never again receive ""official"" letters from big political parties informing us we've been selected to be part of blue-ribbon panels that determine our country's future, provided we donate five grand to be so honored. Sometime, somewhere, in some city, an oriental rug store will have to actually go out of business. All salespeople in nice clothing stores who act like they're better than the people shopping in the store must take acting lessons from people who don't know anything about acting but know a good thing when they see one.

"I guess it's not news to anyone that we've been getting clobbered in the ratings for the last few months. I have to tell you, it's been a very humbling experience. It's an experience that's caused many hours of self-reflection, self-doubt, and, on a few occasions, debilitating bouts of depression, rage, paranoia, and a mild lack of appetite -- nothing unhealthy, I'm just not very hungry (mostly at night, but I think I sleep better on an empty stomach). My point is, we work really hard on this show and when we lose in the ratings it just plain hurts. There's nothing to be done about it except to sit in the pain and pray for it to pass.

"I've been told that we're only as sick as our secrets. I like the sound of that. It would make a particularly good bumper sticker here in Southern California. With that in mind I'd like to engage in a little vanity card therapy and reveal one of my deepest, darkest secrets. There've been times when the mere thought of this secret has nearly overwhelmed me with self-loathing. And yet, there've been other times when I actually took a perverse pride in it. So what is this personal bit of esoterica? I've got your attention now, don't I? You probably even skipped ahead to see if this is really juicy. Well, skip no further. My secret is this: I'm not that smart. Yup, there it is, dug up and thrown into the sunlight. Since I was a little kid I've known that (like it or not) there were an awful lot of people who had a lot more on the ball than I did. Oh, believe me, I've tried to suppress this awareness. I've tried to convince myself that I was special, that I was gifted. But I eventually learned that this secret could be my greatest asset. I learned that with enough bright friends even a dim bulb can light up a room. I like the sound of that. With enough bright friends even a dim bulb can light up a room.

"Interesting Dharma & Greg facts: In the first draft of the first script Greg had a teenage sister who was a pyromaniac. Also in that script was a scene where Dharma's dad was about to be arrested for plants growing on his property that he swore did not belong to him -- while at the same time insisting he had a prescription for glaucoma. The first time I met Jenna was at a breakfast meeting. I ate before she arrived so she wouldn't see what a sloppy eater I was. The original inspiration for these vanity cards came from exec producer Bill Prady, who has also edited each and every one. There's no way I can confirm this, but I suspect Bill might be the smartest man in the world (edit that, buddy). In the first episode exec producer Don Foster came up with the immortal lines for Dharma, ""Comb your frog,"" and, ""Drive your coffee table to Idaho."" I can't confirm this either, but I suspect Don might be a bodhisattva, a fully-realized soul who has voluntarily returned to the physical plane to help lesser souls achieve spiritual freedom. The actual premise of D&G was inspired by the Bruce Springsteen song ""She's the One"" on Born to Run (which has one of the great Bo Diddley riffs of all time). The first time I heard the word dharma was in 1968. The debut Jethro Tull album, (a killer album by the way, far superior to Aqualung) had a song entitled ""Dharma for One."" For the next twenty-five years I didn't know what the word meant. Now I do.",2001-01-30,"Dharma & Greg"
"If you're reading this it means I failed to write a vanity card this week. Early in the season, recognizing that I was bound to miss a deadline sooner or later, I wrote this as sort of an emergency generic card. As such I have no idea when this will air. Which means that I have no clue as to what might have happened or might be happening while you're reading this. So... I'm just gonna have to wing it. First off, I want to congratulate Al Gore on a hard-won victory. What a hoot it was to see the vice-president dance the horah with Tipper at the inauguration. I'm also delighted that I took a deep breath and jumped into the stock market with both feet in August when it hit its all-time low. What a buying opportunity that turned out to be! And how about that Eminem country album, huh? It's a little dark, but man, it's all I've been playing in my car for two weeks now. Needless to say, we all mourn the passing of Howard Stern. And finally, the really big news -- I know I'm going out on a limb here, but what if I'm right? -- who would have thought that we'd finally make contact with an alien race during halftime at the Super Bowl? Boy, that was a shocker. The Jets came back from a four touchdown deficit to pull off the upset of all time. Oh, Howard, I wish you could've been here with us to see it.",2001-01-16,"Dharma & Greg"
"I recently pierced the veil of a long-standing delusion which I had considered to be reality. The delusion was simply this: I thought people were deeply aware of me. I thought the things going on in my life -- my work, relationships, problems, joys, thoughts, insights, attitudes, tastes, desires, fears, good hair days, bad hair days, choice of pants (that's right, choice of pants), etc. ad delusium, were all of some significance to other people. I'm not certain, but I think the delusion is a twisted sort of family heirloom, a neurotic hand-me-down of the fiercely-held immigrant desire to fit in, to be acceptable. Be that as it may, the impact of this hallucination has been a constant state of low-grade anxiety. While it's still a little early to tell, it appears that freedom from it will create an enormous sense of relief and... well... freedom. You people out there, kind and considerate though you may be, don't really give a rat's ass about my life. You give a rat's ass about your life. This means I need no longer obsess over what others think of me (they don't). This means that I am, much to my amazement, more or less invisible. But most importantly, this means that I can begin living a fearless, delusion-free life that is fundamentally true to my basic, God-given nature.

"As I write this I'm sitting in a big, dark cloud of anger. The feeling is highly energetic, almost electric, and, for some strange reason, seems to be most evident in my skin. The experience is vaguely uncomfortable and is dissipating slightly as I write these words. Thinking back, I see now that there was a brief moment when I had a choice as to how I would react to the situation that led to my current condition. I could have just as easily chosen resignation, or amusement, or even sadness. So the obvious question is why did I choose a destructive emotion? I suppose that on some deep, unconscious level I must be hard-wired to believe that anger is the appropriate response. Which leads to the next obvious question: how does one undo a damaging mental process that appears to be inextricably woven into the organism itself? Well, let me state right here, that burning it out doesn't work. God knows I've tried and therefore will not be running for public office anytime soon. Thinking it away (which I'm doing now), is terribly ineffective. And I'm certainly not ready to line up at the great pharmaceutical ""happy"" trough. So what then? Well, perhaps I could give my anger away. I know it sounds silly, but maybe silly is what's called for. Perhaps I could simply give my anger to everyone reading this vanity card... whoa, suddenly I'm feeling very affable. CAUTION: This is not a chain letter. Do not pass the anger on.

"I've got to share something with you. Every time I write a vanity card, I'm quietly astonished that I get away with putting these things on television every week. I mean think about it, at the end of every episode of Dharma & Greg I get two seconds to communicate whatever's on my mind directly to millions of people. This is a remarkable thing, folks. Secret messages from a sitcom writer using the most powerful medium the world has ever known. Sixty-six cards at two seconds a piece means I've received a total of two minutes and twelve seconds of broadcast time to THINK OUT LOUD. Do you know what that kind of time costs? You don't have to be Bill Gates' building contractor to see that they can't keep letting me get away with this. In fact, just writing this might be some sort of death wish. Number 66, the card that killed the cards. The card that never aired. In years to come, people will talk in hushed tones about the fabled #66. Its very existence will be debated. Did Lorre actually write #66? If he did, was it so inflammatory that the big boys pulled the plug on the whole deal? Could it be that the missing #66 held the vital clue to the puzzle, the enigma, that was Chuck Lorre (graduate thesis, anyone?), or is what happened far more mundane? Number 66 was read by the network censors. They thought it a meandering mixture of hubris and paranoia that lacked a good solid joke at the end, but otherwise containing nothing to merit keeping it off television. One thing's for sure, if you're reading this, you know the answer -- but don't let that discourage you from talking about me in hushed tones.",2000-12-05,"Dharma & Greg"
"I recently spoke with a man who is tormented. He thinks he is tormented because he thinks he has a tormentor. He cannot think of a scenario wherein he leaves his tormentor and thus ends his torment. He thinks his only path to serenity is to destroy his tormentor. He thinks the appropriate weapon to accomplish this task is a lawyer. This got me to thinking that perhaps thinking was the real source of his torment. But how can that be? Don't we value thinking? Don't we worship great thinkers? How can this God-given gift that separates us from the animals be deemed a curse? Isn't the alternative to thinking, stupidity? Or is there another alternative? Ask yourself this question, ""When I have a good idea, do I think my way to it, or does it just hit me?"" Which brings me to the theme of this vanity card (finally). I'd like to suggest that we all have inspiration at our disposal at all times. How does inspiration work? How the hell would I know? I just know it's there. Nothing else but inspiration explains a great work of art, and nothing else but thinking could be responsible for making all those ""Lethal Weapon"" movies. I mentioned all this to the tormented man. I told him that perhaps he could find a solution to his troubles by quitting thinking and being open to inspiration. He said he thought I was a moron and threw his shoe at me.

"On October 18, 2000, I celebrated my forty-ninth birthday. I approached the day with a sense of mild dread. This was, after all, the last birthday before the Big Five-Oh, the age where juvenile behavior starts to look pretty pathetic (even in California). Anyway, the natal anniversary arrived and was warmly celebrated by friends and loved ones. I felt good. I felt - dare I say it - vaguely mature. Then my old friend and accountant Steve called to wish me well. We joked about getting old. Where have all the years gone? What about the music the kids listen to these days? How's your prostate? Etc. Then, thinking myself to be his elder, I inquired as to Steve's age. He replied that he'd be turning forty-eight in December. I quickly did the math and determined that since I graduated high school in 1970, he must have graduated in 1971. To my surprise, he said he graduated in 1970. I did some lightning fast re-calculations and asked if he skipped a grade. He said no. Then he asked a simple, penetrating question. He asked me what year I was born. I replied confidently, ""1952."" To which he, always the accountant, asked, ""Well, then how on earth can you be forty-nine?"" I started to protest, but then the impact of his question hit me like a wheelbarrow full of bricks falling on the head of a stupid person. Somewhere along the line, I don't know when, I had omitted a year of my life. But my friend, with his mysterious ability to add and subtract had returned it to me.

"Here's a funny thing. I've been trying to create a sympathetic male character in his early twenties for another project I'm working on. After struggling with a variety of generic, off-the-rack prototypes, I thought why not use myself as a template (at least myself as I was in my early twenties) -- which is where the funny part comes in. When I began using an autobiographical approach I discovered -- to my horror -- that I don't find the ""young me"" to be a particularly sympathetic character. Needless to say, this sort of thinking brings to light all kinds of personal issues I don't really feel are appropriate for a vanity card. But the question remains, what does it mean when you reflect on your life and find that you didn't make a very good hero? Your actions were either self-serving, thoughtless, shallow, craven, vain, vengeful, manipulative or, when you really got it going, all of the above. Well, it means that even though we go through life thinking of ourselves as the leading man, the truth is some of us are better cast as mischief-making sidekicks. Or, in a few cases, unwitting villains who have to learn to forgive themselves. Regardless, I've decided not to take any chances.

"It's strange to think of one's life as analogous to climbing a mountain. It's even stranger to discover, after years of striving to reach the summit, that it's the wrong mountain. This is what happened to Dave. Dave spent twenty years climbing the wrong mountain. And yet he had to consider it time well-spent. After all, no one could have told him he was relentlessly scaling the wrong pile of dirt (not that they didn't try). Dave had to find out for himself. Which is why, in the perverse way life happily screws with us, it turned out to be exactly the right mountain. In order to see things clearly, to understand the actuality of his existence, Dave had to crawl up a treacherous incline that only led to happiness in his poorly-formed, childish dreams. There was never an alternative mountain for ol' Dave, because he was incapable of envisioning one. So he climbed. Until one day, he looked around and saw that he'd reached the top. The pinnacle. The apex. The place where eagles crap. And that's when he noticed the mountain he was always meant to climb far off in the distance.

"When I was a little kid my parents often used a phrase that, to their way of thinking, described the ancient art of meditation. The phrase was ""staring at one's belly button."" This bon mot was most often used to describe someone who was sitting on their butt practicing the equally ancient art of underachieving. ""Look at that guy over there staring at his belly button,"" would be considered an acceptable use of this witticism. Another common remark heard in my formative years was ""He's got a head on his shoulders,"" which was used to express admiration and respect. Smart people who were doing something with their lives had ""heads on the shoulders."" Those who were not quite so clever, well, there was another phrase for where their heads were. The reason I'm bringing this up is that while meditating recently I had a tremendous flash of insight -- I have never stared at my belly button, not while meditating, not while underachieving, and my head has always been on my neck.

I've had four and a half months to write this season's first vanity card -- four and a half months -- and here I am, the morning the damn thing is due, writing like a madman. If nothing else, this exercise in blind panic causes me to reflect on how I crawled out of high school in June, 1970. And to reflect on how my son, following in his father's hand and kneeprints, executed the same escape maneuver in June, 2000. And finally, how thirty years from now, perhaps his son will be putting off for tomorrow what could have easily been done today. Procrastination. I'm good at it. Since I began writing this vanity card, I've managed to peruse both the L.A. and New York Times, drink yet another cup of coffee, hide in the bathroom to read a few more precious pages of a Philip Roth novel.

Well, I had to tell him that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, I've sat in many rooms with many talented comedy writers and every one of them was as mystified as I was as to the origin of jokes.

"One of the great blessings of getting older is realizing, without shame and remorse, what an idiot you've been at earlier stages of your life.

With that in mind it seems self-obsessed to think that the influence of something infinite wouldn't extend to me, or anyone else for that matter.

"I've never understood the phrase ""God's will be done."" It certainly wasn't bandied about while I was growing up on Long Island. Were it not for TV and the movies, I probably would never have heard it at all (prune-faced sodbusters in the Old West seemed to say it a lot). The American psyche of the Fifties and Sixties celebrated our will, not God's -- and we believed our will was limitless. But thankfully, as I've gotten older, I've come to realize that my will is anything but limitless. I can will myself to knowledge, but not to wisdom. I can will myself to pleasure, but not to happiness. I can will myself to money, but not to a sense of security. I can will myself to veggies and aerobics, but not to good health. Hell, I can will myself to bed, but not to sleep. All of which leads me to conclude that my deepest desires were never attainable through the exercise of my will. There's a feeling of relief in that conclusion. And unless God has a Manhattan attitude towards people from Long Island, there's a small bit of hope.",2000-02-15,"Dharma & Greg"
"I was recently asked by a journalist why I write these vanity cards. It seemed like a simple enough question, but the truth is, I was stumped. Why do I write them? Not for money certainly, although I continue to hold out hope. Is it a creative exercise from which I derive great pleasure? Not really. I've always felt that the act of writing isn't nearly as enjoyable as the feeling that comes from ""having written."" So why do I do it? Well, after careful consideration I've come to believe that had I been even a moderately successful communicator in my formative years, I would feel little compulsion to communicate now. This leads me to wonder, would it have been appropriate to have told the journalist that I write these vanity cards because I was incapable of expressing myself as a youngster, a situation which caused me unbearable anguish and is only now beginning to dissipate? Maybe. But I didn't. I told him I write them because it's fun. And this leads me to a question: if he's writing about my writing, what kind of miserable childhood did he have?",2000-02-08,"Dharma & Greg"
"For the last two and a half years I've been amazed and delighted at the response my vanity cards have received from all the folks who watch and tape D & G. I've also been very appreciative of the many Internet sites where each week the cards are transcribed (sometimes accurately, sometimes not). Anyway, it seemed like a logical next step for me to make the cards even more available. Unfortunately, and for reasons I can't go into, I'm not allowed to tell you how this has been done. I can't even give you any hints. About all I can tell you is that all the cards are now out there for your easy perusal, but the only way to find them is to use your imagination. I would also like to mention that if you are clever enough to locate them, please pass it on.Thanks, ChuckLorre.",2000-01-25,"Dharma & Greg"
"Zen mind, beginner's mind. The phrase, popularized by Zen master Shunryu Suzuki, means exactly what it says -- the Zen mind is a beginner's mind. It has no preconceptions or fixed ideas. It is open, questioning and delighted. When I began in television, I had a beginner's mind, but over the years I acquired a mind that was filled with so much stuff that my creativity became frozen. My joy became a dim memory. Obviously the answer was to re-cultivate the ""beginner's mind."" Less obvious was how to jettison this ""acquired mind."" Well, after many months of meditation, I've done just that. The rules and boundaries of the ""acquired mind"" have been replaced with the wonder and delight of a child-like beginner's mind. My writing once again flows effortlessly, and the result is a new sitcom entitled ""Pooping!"" or ""Mr. Poopie"" -- whichever tests better.",2000-01-11,"Dharma & Greg"
"I recently found myself in a room with a group of complete strangers. As each one spoke, I noticed I was making a snap judgement about that person. Sometimes the judgement was warm and appreciative. But more often, it was of the ""Geez, what a vacuum tube this guy is"" variety. At first I was troubled by this ugly mental reflex. But then I was hit with a flash of insight. As I gazed around the room I realized that if each person was animated by the same energy -- call it God, call it carbon-based, chemical doowhackies -- then each person was essentially life doing the best that it can. Suddenly my judgements were replaced by a pervasive feeling of love. Emboldened by my epiphany, I meditated upon a TV executive with whom I'd recently had difficult relations. I visualized this person not as an arrogant prig, but as ""life doing the best that it can."" Which is when my insight grew deeper. I now believe that the ability to suspend judgement and flow love works really well with complete strangers.",1999-12-14,"Dharma & Greg"
"Dear Vanity Card Readers,I regret to inform you that I will not be writing a vanity card this week due to illness. Nothing serious, just your average, common cold versus aspirin, antihistamines, vaporubs, humidifiers, throat lozenges, vitamins, homeopathic remedies, buckets of chicken soup that I can't smell, and enough squeezably-soft facial tissue to exfoliate my nose down to the skull. But what I find most fascinating is that while nothing's worked, I persist in thinking I can ""beat"" a common cold. Why am I incapable of accepting my helplessness? Is the inability to accept helplessness a survival trait or the cause of suffering? I can't amaze my friends at cocktail parties by levitating the dip, but I accept that I'm powerless over gravity and thus do not suffer. Likewise, I can't sing like Joe Cocker, but I accept my inability to emulate Ray Charles and feel just fine about it. Anyway, there won't be a vanity card this week. Geez, I feel clammy, maybe I should take some more zinc. Yeah, zinc, that'll do it.",1999-11-30,"Dharma & Greg"

"The concept of prayer, as I've always understood it, was that one beseeched God for what one wanted. Make me rich, famous, sexy, happy, married, single, whatever -- just improve upon the status quo. In my humble opinion, this is a waste of time. That's not to say that I think prayer is a waste of time. In fact, I now believe that prayer is essential to a happy life -- just not the kind of prayer that asks for stuff. What I now believe is that the true purpose of prayer is for us to get our actions and thoughts into alignment with the universe as it really is, as opposed to how we wish it to be. If we assume an omnipotent God, then God is everything. In other words, God is the universe as it really is. With that in mind, I've been praying a lot lately so that I might properly align myself. The two messages I've received thus far are: ""be kind and loving"" and ""have fun while it lasts"". While I find that comforting, it troubles me that the two ideas seem incompatible. Maybe I've been in L.A. too long.",1999-11-16,"Dharma & Greg"
"For many years I've been fascinated by the phenomenon known as automatic writing. If this strange occurrence could be made to work in television comedy, and I could harness it, my productivity would no doubt increase tenfold. I decided that there was only one way to find out. I would have to turn on the computer, close my eyes, and trust that some cosmic power would embrace my humble consciousness, causing my fingers to fly across the keyboard in an explosion of cutting-edge humor. Please keep in mind that I claim no authorship for what follows.",1999-11-09,"Dharma & Greg"
"Thirty thousand feet in the air. Strapped into a seat that doubles as a flotation device. Thinking about faith. Faith in airplanes. In jet engines. In pilots. Faith that the sullen, unshaven guy across the aisle isn't the mindless pawn of a master terrorist with a deep hatred for America, the Great Satan. Then, assuming a safe landing, faith that the cabbie didn't have a fight with his adulterous wife who hides her deceit behind sly jokes about his unremarkable sexual prowess forcing him to soothe his anguish with that fifth of Jim Beam he keeps stashed beneath the seat. And, of course, faith that the doorknob leading out of the public bathroom isn't tainted with a flesh-eating bacteria that came to Earth imbedded in a small, flat meteorite that some unsuspecting child picked up to skip across the surface of a lake. Yes, faith is a wonderful thing. Without it, this world would surely be a fearful place. Once again, thanks for reading my vanity card. Have a nice day.",1999-11-02,"Dharma & Greg"
"In an earlier vanity card I made a joke that involved sticking rockets in the asses of fat people, thus enabling them to fly to Miami for a three-day weekend. At this time I am forced to admit that the joke was in bad taste and may have hurt the feelings of some of my readers who are calorically challenged. I especially regret the gaffe since frankly, I should know better. I spent two years on ""Roseanne"" where I was repeatedly beaten over the head with a simple truth: ""fat"" jokes are cheap jokes. I was also told that I was an incompetent hack intent on destroying the show, but that's another matter for another vanity card. The purpose here is to make amends to my corpulent compadres; my endomorphic, abdominous buds; my swag-bellied, moonfaced, roly-poly pals. This is not the place for any more thoughtless japes at the bloated, bulky or broad of beam. From this moment on, I solemnly vow to restrain from any and all juvenile badinage aimed at the jumbo dumplings who walk among us. Thank you, and good night.",1999-10-26,"Dharma & Greg"
"Once upon a time there was a wave. The name of the wave was, no surprise, Dave. Dave the wave. Dave was a big, powerful wave. His massive blue body surged across the surface of the ocean with great majesty and deceptive speed. Oh yes, Dave was quite a wave. From the moment he rose up from the ocean he felt special. He felt invincible. Ferocious storms battered him with wind and rain, great ships sliced through his very heart, and yet he rolled on. It was not for him to stop and consider the other waves. To stop was to die. Waves have to keep moving... or else. But then one day Dave saw a strange darkness on the horizon and, for the first time in his life, felt fear. What could it be? Was it connected to the laughing creature sliding across his face on a piece of wood? But before he could make sense of it all, he crashed down into the darkness. For a brief moment he felt a weird, splashing feeling, then oblivion. Dave was no more. He was now a part of the sea. And as we all know, the sea loves to make waves.",1999-10-19,"Dharma & Greg"

As you can see, I've changed the card to black print on a white background in the hope that this will facilitate reading while you ""pause"" your videotape. I also wanted to use this card to talk about what I did on my summer vacation. Rather than go to Europe, or some exotic locale, I chose to go on a spiritual journey. Among other things, my journey led to this stunning realization: For as long as I can remember, I've mistakenly felt that God, or some kind of higher power, had taken everyone aside and explained to them what this life was all about. And for some twisted, cosmic reason, it was decided that I alone would remain in the dark. Uncovering this self-centered misconception was an enormous breakthrough for me. For the first time in my life I didn't feel like an ignorant, frightened outsider. As a result, next summer, one more ignorant, frightened insider is going to Paris!",NA,"Dharma & Greg"

"When I was a young man I got this guitar and sorta learned how to make it talk. Not as articulately as the guys I worshipped, but I did manage to get that old Strat to speak with a certain fluency and syntax. On good nights, I could make it scream with anger or cry like a baby. There were even times when my hands did things that would utterly surprise me -- when the thousands of hours of practice exploded into music that seemed to come from someone else entirely. I couldn't imagine a life without three pickups and that cool setting between treble and midrange. But eventually I realized my teenage dream was turning into an adult nightmare. In order to provide for my family, I traded the six-string Fender for a four-camera sitcom. I guess in hindsight it was a good trade, although on good nights while writing and producing ""Roseanne,"" ""Grace Under Fire"" and ""Cybill,"" you could hear me screaming and crying like a baby.",1999-02-17,"Dharma & Greg"
"When Richie figured out that the universe truly was an illusion, he was quite dumbfounded at the simplicity of the insight. Unless some sort of awareness exists to perceive the whole shabang, the whole shabang effectively does not exist. It could be an infinite space filled with stars and planets, or a plaid snot rag wrapped around a bottle of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. Or, to put it another way, when a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, there is no sound. For a sound to be a sound, there must be some sort of ear hooked to some sort of intelligence that says something like, ""What was that?"" Otherwise the sound might as well be a plaid snot rag wrapped around a bottle of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. So now Richie understood that energy and mass only exist because of awareness, which means they have no inherent existence.

Just killing time, looking for a clever point of view, a sweepingly original articulation on the mystery of life, anything. Oh hell, who am I kidding?

Richie, however, never really believed he could unravel this mystery which had baffled the greatest minds of humankind. He certainly didn't have anything resembling a great mind. Then it occurred to him... maybe a great mind was not what was needed to see behind the veil of illusion. Maybe true perception comes from a great heart. This realization troubled Richie, for he knew in his gut that he didn't have a great heart either. But then he thought, perhaps with some desperation, maybe the secret was in having a great gut.

Despite all the things for which I need to be forgiven, in my heart I know I meant well. I believe that my sins were driven by fear -- fear of being unloved, fear of poverty, fear of death, fear, fear, fear. What can I say? I was deeply influenced by a frightened mother. I'm not casting blame here; God knows what she dealt with as a little kid. Second, I tried hard. When it came to taking care of my children, I allowed nothing to get in my way -- even a closer relationship with them. I attribute that sin to ""fear of being a bad provider.""

He liked the sound of that -- ""San Bernadino to Zimbabwe!"" Carolyn, of course, wouldn't feel like she deserved such adulation (and who does, really). At which point she'd quickly descend into a deadly spiral of drugs and miscellaneous self-destructive behavior, culminating in her untimely death. The world would mourn, but not Mort Tayback.

"It was a novel thought for Dave: What if he's not someone who is perpetually in need of repair? What if the real grunt work of self-improvement is simply being aware of the things one thinks, feels, says and does? Dave decided to put his novel thought to the test by being aware of the first feeling that came along. As it turned out, his first brain guest was the feeling of horny. Dave was aware that he was horny. But, his awareness told him he was not so much horny as lonely. And the loneliness was really just a deep-seeded fear that he was unworthy of being loved......even by himself. Suddenly, Dave no longer felt horny. Now he felt hungry. But not so much hungry as sad. And the sadness was really just a deep-seeded fear that he was unworthy of being loved......even by himself. Which caused Dave to no longer feel hungry. Now he felt insane.

"Richie was in perfect health when he began reviewing his life. His reasoning was simple: if your life passes before you moments before you die, why not do it when things are going good? That way, when you're coughing up blood and forgetting your childrens' names, you can just lay back and enjoy the morphine-drip carpet ride that takes you back to God. Richie's life review began with his teenage years because his actions during those years effectively blocked out all memory of the preceding years. He began slowly, looking for moments when he'd been kind and loving, generous and cheerful. Unfortunately, all he could remember was a bewildered, terrified, selfish, horny, angry, pimple-faced knucklehead. But that was okay. Part of the life review involved extending forgiveness.

I pulled over and tried to help. I knew the thing to do was to somehow stop the bleeding, but my hands were frozen. Instead, I told an unconscious teenager to hang in there, everything would be okay. A better Good Samaritan joined me eventually. He found an old shirt in the car and applied pressure to the kid's neck while I directed traffic. Then a cop arrived and told us that he would take over.

But Dave was still unhappy, because no matter how hard he fought, winning was an illusion -- a mirage. But then, Dave thought, what would happen if I just gave up? This universe isn't meant to be dominated. It's an incomprehensible vastness which created us and to which we'll all return. So Dave surrendered and discovered a happiness he never dreamed of.

But when the big day arrived, many were confused. There was Richie, walking and talking, actually having quite a good time. What kind of death was this? What Richie had failed to explain in the invitations was that the death he was celebrating was that of his carefully constructed ego. From this day on, Richie would cease to be Richie (except for tax purposes). For all other purposes he would simply be a continuously unfolding manifestation of the universe -- a process not a thing. He tried to explain how blissfully liberating this was, that this was the enlightenment sought by wise men throughout the ages, but no one really understood. Of course it didn't help matters much that he kept pestering several female guests to show the continuously unfolding manifestation their sweater puppies.",1998-10-21,"Dharma & Greg"

When Dave looked around the room, he realized he was also Kate and Lorraine and Ted and Lenny. Heck, he was also the dying philodendran on the windowsill. Suddenly he felt enormous compassion for all these variations on himself, or rather ""ourself"", which he thought was a more appropriate label. The pain of loneliness and the fear of death were suddenly swept away by this one blinding flash of insight. It was so obvious! There are no separate forms of life. Life was life, just sort of wandering around looking at itself, loving itself, and unfortunately killing itself.

So, bright boy that he was, he worked hard, drank hard, and chased soft women. Anything to forget. Anything to kill the pain. Until his dream came true. Until that amazing day when Kate came to him and said she had been wrong, that Richie was indeed the man for her and she wanted them to be together always.

His mind was actually in one of those little butt bags that kids like to wear these days. Now, of course, Dave didn't start the meeting with his mind in a butt bag. When one of the muckamucks was summing up a vague thesis with a meandering generality, Dave's mind was very much in and around his head. But then, on its own volition, Dave's mind imagined all the attendees dancing around naked and squirting one another in their private parts with brightly-colored water pistols.

But something else happened that night with Kate. He actually made love. He kissed her with love. He touched her with love. And finally, he entered her with a sense of devotion that dissolved all the fear boundaries which had caused him to be so alone. Unfortunately, Kate was just drunk and horny.

"In February of '97, Dottie and I set out to create a series revolving around a woman whose personality is not a neurotic product of societal and parental conditioning, but of her own free-flowing, compassionate mind. In short, we tried to create a character we personally knew nothing about. Then the most astonishing thing happened: this fictional character began to teach us to think differently. For instance, while writing, we'd be forced to ask, ""how would Dharma deal with the emotion of anger?"" Oh sure, she'd feel it -- feel it completely. But then she'd be just as likely to let it go like a cluster of ugly balloons. Okay, fine, she'd let it go. How did she let it go? Probably by recognizing that no matter what the circumstances, emotions are self-generated. No one reaches inside your brain and flips the ""anger"" switch. So what does that teach us? Well, for me it means that all the anger I feel toward Cybill is ultimately created by... me. Whoa, there goes an ugly balloon! Thanks, Dharma!",1998-05-20,"Dharma & Greg"

No, of course not... unless we never ""were"" at all, unless our actual identity is a nothing that embraces everything, but an ""everything"" can't look at itself so we create the illusion of separate selves, which leads to the illusion of survival, which of course leads to all of our pain and suffering.

It's more like being in the middle of a swarm of bees, all of them flying insanely about, occasionally stinging for no apparent reason. Yup, bees, definitely -- thoughts are bees. In fact, I believe my entire understanding of the world is based on my thoughts, which are generated by my emotions, which are generated by ... well, I guess my reaction to stuff that happens. Anyway, I understand the world through the filter of my thoughts and emotions. If this is pretty much how you understand the world, it brings up an interesting concept. Probably since we were infants, none of us have directly perceived this world we live in. What does it mean to directly perceive something? Well, I suppose it would mean to be totally with that thing, as opposed to observing and thinking about it. It's a duality issue. Here's me, here's you. here's me, here's the sofa. Ya dig where this is going? We live on a planet dominated by a race of beings whose only connection to reality is constantly buzzing, mental bees.

If not, that's okay. Don't get down on yourself. Remember, this is just an experiment. We can try it again. This time feel your lips curl up gently at the corners. You try to fight it, but your mouth seems to have taken on a life of its own. As you continue reading you can't help but notice that you are now smiling like the execs at Paramount after they realized they got a piece of Titanic for chump change. See? The power of words. In this case used for good. If you would like an example of words used for evil, call your mother and tell her you're really starting to make progress in therapy.",1998-04-01,"Dharma & Greg"
"I believe that the very act of believing in something causes us to distance ourselves from that thing, thus a duality is created: oneself and the thing in which one believes. Now since we all know that in order to fully understand a thing one must be that thing -- walk a mile in its shoes so to speak -- it seems obvious that the state of believing in something inevitably causes us to not truly understand that thing in which we believe. This noncomprehension leads to all sorts of difficulties. ""I believe in love"" has a better than even chance of leading to divorce, while ""I believe in God"" seems to end in variations on the Spanish Inquisition. But -- and it's a big but -- if one were love, one couldn't help but be affectionate and caring towards oneself and others. If one were God, one would act toward all beings and all things as if they were one's own creations. And that, my friends, is the secret of life in a two-second vanity card. Of course, the secret could also be ""Sit, Ubu, sit."" We have to keep an open mind.",1998-03-04,"Dharma & Greg"
"Once again, thank you for videotaping ""Dharma & Greg"" and freeze-framing on my vanity card. For those of you who are new, this is my sporadic attempt to share my personal beliefs with millions of people (hence the term ""vanity""). This attempt has led me into communicating many deep thoughts, and, I'm afraid to say, quite a few shallow ones as well. But what I've found most interesting is that after a few weeks, I've discovered myself scrounging for new beliefs. Things about which I could stand up and say with pride, ""I believe in this, dammit!"" Now that's not to say that I couldn't fill the card with a lot of mindless aphorisms. But do I waste my precious moment in the sun by proclaiming, ""I believe that sex with multiple partners in a moving vehicle isn't all it's cracked up to be?"" No, I do not. Do I squander this priceless opportunity to announce, ""I believe we are better than the animals because we're capable of reading in the bathroom?"" Once again, I do not. And so it is for this reason, I have no beliefs to share with you this week. No wait... actually I do believe that JFK had a much better understanding of the word ""perks"".",1998-02-25,"Dharma & Greg"
"Well, once again I'd like to thank you for not only watching, but videotaping ""Dharma & Greg."" I know you're busy, so this shows a wonderful commitment on your part and I want you to acknowledge that commitment with a big ol' Chuck Lorre vanity card hug. Okay, with that done let's get on with why you're here, to learn more of my personal beliefs. I believe that this episode, which on the surface deals with a funny Valentine's adventure, in fact grapples with the weighty issue of Weltschmerz. Weltschmerz is a German word which loosely means ""world suffering deriving from the inevitability of reality to never match up with our expectations."" Boy, only the Germans could come up with a word like that. Anyway, in this episode Greg is in Weltschmerz hell as he discovers that life is never quite like the brochure. Dharma, on the other hand, recognizes that life is a flowing river and happiness exists only when one embraces its ever-changing nature. From this dilemma we draw the comedic essence of our story. Finally, I believe that when I retire and teach sitcom writing at a community college, I'll use this theme for one of my classes to impress the kids.",1998-02-11,"Dharma & Greg"

"Once again, thanks for video-taping ""Dharma & Greg,"" and freeze-framing on my vanity card. The following are a few more of my beliefs: I believe that El Niño is an international conspiracy perpetrated by evil roofing contractors. I believe it's high time The Beatles came clean on that whole ""Paul is dead"" thing. I believe that anyone who can read and speak clearly can be a network news anchorperson -- but not necessarily a weatherman. I believe that if I rid myself of insatiable cravings, lusts, paranoia, deep-seated anger and ill-will towards others, I'll be a much better person. I believe that TV is the cause of all the violence and immorality in our society -- ha! just kidding. I believe there's no business like show business, although if you're over-paid for feeding a big, scary monster, then that might be sort of like it. That's all for now, gotta go make a TV show. Once again, thanks for watching and keep checking for more of my beliefs real soon!",1997-11-19,"Dharma & Greg"
"Once again, thank you for video-taping ""Dharma & Greg"" and freeze-framing on my vanity card. I'd like to take this opportunity to share with you some more of my beliefs. I believe that the guy who invented those speed bumps in the freeway that snap you back into consciousness when you're drifting into a nearby semi should be given a big hug. I believe that there are actually several cures for the summertime blues. I believe that in my earlier statement of beliefs, I erroneously believed that beer was a gateway drug that led to vodka. After intensive consultation with ABC executives, I now believe I was very, very wrong. Beer is good. Especially beer brewed by major manufacturers, and enjoyed in a responsible fashion. I believe I've spent my life expecting people to behave in a certain way. I believe that when they didn't behave according to my expectations, I became angry, sad, confused and occasionally fearful. I believe these expectations are the reason I've been angry, sad, confused and occasionally fearful more than I care to admit. As a result, I now believe my expectations are the real problem. I believe that everyone has this very same problem, and they ought to start acting accordingly. Well, that's all for now. I hope you continue to watch ""Dharma & Greg"" and check in on my vanity card for more of my personal beliefs.",1997-10-01,"Dharma & Greg"
"Thank you for videotaping ""Dharma & Greg"" and freeze-framing on my vanity card. I'd like to take this opportunity to share with you some of my personal beliefs. I believe that everyone thinks they can write. This is not true. It is true, however, that everyone can direct. I believe that the Laws of Karma do not apply to show business, where good things happen to bad people on a fairly regular basis. I believe that what doesn't kill us makes us bitter. I believe that the obsessive worship of movie, TV and sports figures is less likely to produce spiritual gain than praying to Thor. I believe that Larry was a vastly underrated Stooge, without whom Moe and Curly could not conform to the comedy law of three (thanks, Lee). I believe my kids are secretly proud of me. I believe that if you can't find anything nice to say about people whom you've helped to make wildly successful and then they stabbed you in the back, then don't say anything at all. I believe I have a great dog, maybe the greatest dog in the whole wide world, yes, he is! I believe that beer is a gateway drug that leads, inevitably, to vodka and somebody oughta do something about it. I believe that when ABC reads this, I'm gonna be in biiiig trouble. I believe that Tina Turner's ""River Deep, Mountain High"", is the greatest rock song ever recorded. Once again, thanks for watching ""Dharma & Greg"".
