Scrape and Analyse Chuck Lorre's Vanity Cards

## Who?

The guy that makes television shows like Will & Grace, Grace Under Fire (which I remember enjoying when I was young), and the Big Bang Theory. 

### A Quick Note

The Big Bang Theory often amuses me if I watch it, but sometimes the scientific terminology is wrong (I remember that one of the characters said negative reinforcement when he was really referring to punishment - he wanted to stop behavior) and I get so tired of people typing things like, "Oh my God! I watch the Big Bang Theory and I am such a nerd!". These are generally the same people that will bolster that claim by saying that they enjoy the "Avengers" movies. 

## Why?

These are things that I had seen at various points (I only watch his shows on occasion), but never really gave them too much attention. I find that I can enjoy most of his work, but I would not consider myself to be a "fan" of any of it.  Not too long ago, I saw a blurb about his most-complained-about vanity cards and it seemed as though there could be some interesting things to read. I cannot say that I was disappointed.  I figured it would be a good opportunity to have some fun.

Honestly, the having fun aspect is the biggest part.  Scraping data from the web is fun and is getting easier thanks to that fellow at RStudio (I did not have any problems with using xpaths in XML, but rvest has made it even easier). It always presents a good challenge, in that you never know if the content is going to be amenable to be scraped in an efficient manner. For this reason, I commend the person behind Chuck Lorre's vanity card site.


## Mild Disclaimer

I find these amusing. I enjoy some, but not others. I do not find any of them to be offensive, but I will not promise that someone else might not.
